# FormSelect

## Purpose

The closed control is exactly `.k-input`: 4px, overlay background, focus ring
and glow, with a 3.5px `text-muted` chevron. Native `<select>` popups cannot be
styled; their operating-system popup is sanctioned and `accent-color` themes
what it can.

## Use when

Use `FormSelect.vue` in Vue portals or the framework-neutral
`railgrid-form-select` from `form-select.ts` in the Quickstart portal when a
a shared, viewport-aware single-select popup and consistent option presentation are required. Both provide the shared
combobox/listbox behavior instead of relying on a browser popup.

## Avoid when

Use a native `<select>` for short, stable choices when the operating-system popup supports the task, especially for platform-owned touch interaction. Use a searchable picker for long or frequently changing choices after testing the task; search is not a shipped FormSelect capability. Providers must not copy or restyle the shared
`.k-*` recipes.

## Anatomy and variants

The Vue and framework-neutral implementations compose the input and menu
recipes and provide single-select combobox/listbox semantics, keyboard
navigation, disabled options, and viewport-aware teleported listbox positioning.
Providers must not copy or restyle their `.k-*` recipes.

## Behavior

`FormSelect.vue` accepts its typed Vue props and `v-model`. The framework-neutral
element accepts `options`, `value`, and optional `placeholder`, `labelledby`, and
`describedby` properties, then emits one bubbling `change` event whose `detail`
is the selected string. The native `<select>` fallback retains its
operating-system popup behavior.

The form owner must validate required FormSelect values, prevent submission
when invalid, set `invalid`, connect the message with `describedby`, and
focus the first invalid control or an error summary. Pass `errorMessage` for the shared danger border and icon-led corrective message. Keep any separate help text associated with `describedby`. The `required` prop
announces the requirement; the button and optional hidden input do not provide
native required-field validation. Retain the draft and clear the error after
a valid selection.

## Content

This component documents single-select behavior only. If search or multi-select
is needed later, compose a `.k-input` trigger, the shared dropdown panel, and
`.k-badge`-style selected tags; validate search and multi-selection behavior before standardizing an implementation. The current component does not provide type-ahead or search.

## Layout and responsive behavior

The closed control is exactly `.k-input`: 4px, overlay background, focus ring
and glow, with a 3.5px `text-muted` chevron. Product-consistent listboxes are
teleported and positioned with viewport awareness.

## Accessibility

The shared popup provides single-select combobox/listbox semantics, keyboard
navigation, and disabled-option handling. Use the [accessible interaction
policy](../accessibility/interaction.md) for the cross-surface keyboard, focus,
contrast, touch, and reduced-motion contract.

## Code and evidence

The canonical implementations are [`FormSelect.vue`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/FormSelect.vue)
and [`form-select.ts`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit/form-select.ts), with
shared styling in [`railgrid-ui.css`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit/railgrid-ui.css).
Distribution is checked by `make verify-portalkit`.
