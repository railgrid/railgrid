// Package tunnel is the edges provider's reverse-tunnel plane:
// the revdial ConnManager, the agent-ingress handler that terminates agent
// tunnels, and the consumer edgeproxy handler that streams k8s/ssh back down
// them.
//
// Multi-replica: revdial dialers are still process-local (the dialer IS the
// accepted socket), but with a Registry wired (SetRegistry) the ConnManager
// claims, renews and releases a Lease per tunnel in the provider workspace.
// Those Leases are the only place tunnel liveness is recorded: the edge
// lifecycle reconciler derives Edge status.connected/phase/lastHeartbeatTime
// from them, and the tunnel plane never writes those fields itself. With a
// relay token as well, the ConnManager becomes cluster-aware — Load resolves
// peer-held tunnels to relayed remoteDialers, HasConnection/Keys answer
// fleet-wide, and revdial pickups are forwarded to the owning replica by the
// replica-addressed pickup path. Each agent keeps exactly one control
// connection, to whichever replica the Service handed it.
