## Local Development with Tilt

For the fastest local dev loop, use [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) instead of running `make` in multiple terminals.

### Prerequisites
- [tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html) ≥ v0.35.0

### Start everything

```bash
make tilt
```

This wraps `tilt up -f Tiltfile` and first checks that no local kcp is running
and that nothing already holds `:9443` or Tilt's own port — the two stacks
(`make tilt` and `make tilt-cluster`) cannot run side by side. Plain `tilt up`
still works if you want to skip the checks.

This starts two local resources:

1. **`portal`** — Vite dev server on `http://localhost:3000/ui/`  
   Builds provider portal symlinks automatically and watches `portal/src/` for hot reload.

2. **`hub`** — `railgrid-hub` binary with embedded KCP, static auth, and portal dev proxy  
   Serves HTTPS on `https://console.127.0.0.1.sslip.io:9443` (listening on :9443, so `https://localhost:9443` works too). The hub depends on the portal resource and rebuilds on Go file changes.

### Smoke test

```bash
curl -k https://console.127.0.0.1.sslip.io:9443/healthz   # hub healthz
curl -k https://console.127.0.0.1.sslip.io:9443/ui/       # portal via hub proxy
curl http://localhost:3000/ui/           # portal direct (Vite dev server)
```

### Stop everything

```bash
tilt down
```

### Tips
- The Tiltfile intentionally skips the slow provider-portal Vite builds (`make build-hub`) because `--portal-dev-url` proxies all UI traffic to the Vite dev server.
- If port 3000 is already taken, kill the existing Vite process (`pkill -f vite`) before running `tilt up`.

### Providers from other repositories

If you develop an external provider, such as the private providers in
`../providers`, add it to the `make tilt-cluster` session with
`make tilt-cluster EXTERNAL_PROVIDERS_DIR=../providers`. See
[External providers with Tilt](docs/external-providers-tilt.md) for the
settings and for the contract a provider repository implements.

## Join Token Flow

```
railgrid edge create <name>
        │
        ▼
TokenReconciler (pkg/hub/controllers/edge/token_reconciler.go)
  - generates 44-char crypto/rand base64url token
  - writes to edge.status.joinToken
  - sets Registered=False condition
        │
        ▼
railgrid edge join-command <name>
  → prints: railgrid agent run --token <joinToken> --edge-name <name> ...
        │
        ▼
Agent starts (pkg/agent/agent.go)
  opts.Token != "" → join-token mode
  - skips registerEdge (token is NOT a kcp bearer)
  - skips edge_reporter (hub owns status in this mode)
  - builds sshHeaders from --ssh-user/--ssh-password flags
        │
        ▼
pkg/agent/tunnel/tunneler.go: StartProxyTunnel(extraHeaders)
  - WebSocket upgrade to hub /proxy endpoint
  - merges sshHeaders into upgrade request
        │
        ▼
pkg/virtual/builder/agent_proxy_builder_v2.go: ServeHTTP
  - authorizeByJoinToken validates token against edge.status.joinToken
  - extractSSHCredsFromHeaders reads X-Railgrid-SSH-* headers
  - markEdgeConnected(edge, sshCreds):
      • builds agent kubeconfig (SA token from edge-<name>-kubeconfig secret)
      • sends kubeconfig back to agent in X-Railgrid-Agent-Kubeconfig response header
      • storeSSHCredentials → creates Secret, writes status.sshCredentials
      • clears joinToken, sets Registered=True, sets phase=Ready
        │
        ▼
Agent receives kubeconfig (cmd/railgrid-agent/main.go)
  - saves to ~/.railgrid/agent-<name>.kubeconfig
  - clears opts.Token (reconnect without token from now on)
        │
        ▼
On restart: agent loads saved kubeconfig automatically
  opts.UsingSavedKubeconfig=true → skips registerEdge, skips edge_reporter
```

### Why the agent skips `edge_reporter` in join-token mode

The `edge_reporter` uses the agent's credentials to patch `edge.status` directly via the kcp API. Join tokens are not kcp Service Account credentials — they're a hub-internal bootstrap secret validated only by the hub's `authorizeByJoinToken` handler. So the hub itself calls `markEdgeConnected` / `markEdgeDisconnected` to update status, and the agent skips the reporter entirely.

After token exchange, the agent holds a real kcp SA kubeconfig and future reconnects use the normal `edge_reporter` path.

---

## Edge Proxy URL Format

Once an Edge is `Ready`, `edge.status.URL` is set to:

```
https://<hub-external-url>/clusters/<workspace-id>/apis/railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/edges/<name>/proxy/k8s
```

This URL is a virtual workspace endpoint served by the hub's agent-proxy virtual workspace handler. The hub:

1. Validates the caller's bearer token against kcp.
2. Looks up the Edge resource to verify it is Ready and the tunnel is active.
3. Forwards the raw TCP stream to the agent over the revdial tunnel.
4. The agent forwards to `localhost:<kubeAPIPort>` on the target cluster.

`railgrid edge kubeconfig <name>` generates a kubeconfig pointing to this URL with the user's hub bearer token embedded.

---

## SSH Server-Mode Internals

### Connection path

```
railgrid ssh <name>
    │
    │  WebSocket upgrade → hub /clusters/<ws>/…/edges/<name>/proxy/ssh
    ▼
hub agent-proxy handler (pkg/virtual/builder/agent_proxy_builder_v2.go)
    │
    │  dials agent over revdial tunnel
    ▼
railgrid-agent (server mode, pkg/agent/agent.go)
    │
    │  forwards raw TCP to localhost:<ssh-proxy-port> (default 22)
    ▼
sshd on the target host
```

### SSH credentials in join-token mode

When the agent starts with `--token` and `--ssh-user`/`--ssh-password`:

1. Agent builds `X-Railgrid-SSH-User` and `X-Railgrid-SSH-Password` headers.
2. These are passed to `StartProxyTunnel` as `extraHeaders`.
3. Hub's `extractSSHCredsFromHeaders` reads them on the first connection.
4. `storeSSHCredentials` creates a `railgrid-ssh-<name>` Secret in `railgrid-system`.
5. `edge.status.sshCredentials` is populated with the username and secret ref.

### SSH host key verification

The provider verifies the sshd host key on every SSH session and fails closed
(`providers/edges/internal/tunnel/agent_proxy_builder.go`, `newSSHClient`):

- **Key source.** `spec.sshHostKey` (operator pin, authorized_keys format) wins.
  Otherwise `status.sshHostKey`, which the agent reports once on tunnel connect
  (`X-Railgrid-SSH-HostKey`). The provider records the reported key **write-once**:
  a later report with a different fingerprint is not applied and instead sets
  the `SSHHostKeyChanged` condition (both fingerprints in the message). Resolve
  it by pinning `spec.sshHostKey` or clearing `status.sshHostKey`.
- **Unparseable key** → the session is refused.
- **No key known** → `spec.sshHostKeyPolicy` decides:
  - `strict` (default): the session is refused until a key is pinned or
    reported.
  - `tofu`: the key presented on the first session is trusted, recorded in
    `status.sshHostKey`, and enforced from then on.
- **Legacy escape hatch.** `edges-provider serve --allow-unverified-ssh-host-key`
  (env `RAILGRID_EDGES_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSH_HOST_KEY=true`, chart value
  `allowUnverifiedSSHHostKey`) opens sessions to edges with no known key
  without verification. It is logged at verbosity 0 on startup and on every
  use, and never affects an edge whose key is known. A malformed value for the
  env form (e.g. `treu`) is a startup error rather than a silent `false`.

The handshake itself is bounded: `newSSHClient` arms a deadline on the tunnelled
connection (the caller's context deadline, else 30s) before
`gossh.NewClientConn`, which takes no context, and clears it once the session is
up. Without it a stalled tunnel pins the handler goroutine indefinitely.

Every session emits two structured lines at verbosity 0: `SSH session opened`
(cluster, edge, caller, SSH user, mode, exec command, remote address, host key
fingerprint) and `SSH session ended` (plus duration and error). A session
refused before opening still gets the `ended` line with `opened=false`. When the
caller's TokenReview fails the lines carry `caller=unknown` and `callerError`.

Two properties keep those lines trustworthy:

- **`remoteAddr` is the LAST `X-Forwarded-For` hop**, not the first. Exactly one
  trusted proxy (the hub backend) fronts this handler and *appends* the peer it
  saw; every entry to its left is caller-supplied and forgeable. With no header
  the peer address is used, port stripped. The value is always a parsed IP or
  `unknown` — junk is never echoed.
- **`exec` is escaped and bounded.** The command is a raw query parameter;
  control characters (newlines above all, which would otherwise forge extra
  audit records) are escaped rather than dropped, and the value is truncated at
  256 runes with an explicit `...[truncated]` marker.

Fingerprints in conditions and audit lines distinguish `unknown` (no key
recorded) from `unparseable` (a key is recorded but malformed).

### SSH username mapping (OIDC)

With OIDC auth, the SSH username is derived from the user's token claim:
- Default: email local-part (`alice@example.com` → `alice`)
- Configurable via the OIDC username claim in hub config

With static token auth, username defaults to `root`.

### Keepalive

The SSH test suite holds connections open for `--ssh-keepalive-duration` (default 60s). The hub sends keepalive pings every 30s over the WebSocket; agents respond to prevent idle-timeout disconnection.

---

## kcp Workspace Hierarchy

railgrid uses kcp for multi-tenant API isolation. Each user/team gets a dedicated kcp workspace:

```
root workspace
└── user-<id> workspace
    ├── Edge resources
    ├── VirtualWorkload resources
    └── Placement resources
```

The hub deploys kcp's `APIBinding` resources to make the railgrid CRDs available in each workspace.

### Static token scoping

Static dev tokens (e.g. `dev-token`) are scoped to a specific kcp workspace path. The workspace path appears in the kubeconfig server URL:

```
https://console.127.0.0.1.sslip.io:9443/clusters/<workspace-id>/...
```

`ClusterNameFromKubeconfig` (in `test/e2e/framework/cluster.go`) extracts the workspace ID from the server URL.

---

## MCP Integration

railgrid exposes all connected Kubernetes clusters as a single [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server. AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) connect to this endpoint and can interact with all registered clusters using natural language.

### KubernetesMCP CRD (railgrid.ai/v1alpha1)

**API group:** `railgrid.ai/v1alpha1`  
**Kind:** `KubernetesMCP`

The `KubernetesMCP` object is automatically created as `default` in every tenant workspace by the hub bootstrapper. It acts as the configuration object for the multi-cluster MCP endpoint.

```yaml
apiVersion: railgrid.ai/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesMCP
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  edgeSelector: {}   # empty = all kubernetes-type edges; use label selectors to restrict
  readOnly: false    # set true to disable write operations (create/delete/apply)
status:
  URL: "https://hub.example.com/services/mcp/root:railgrid:user-<id>/apis/railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/kubernetesmcps/default/mcp"
  connectedEdges:
  - my-cluster
  - home-lab
```

### MCP URL structure

```
https://<hub>/services/mcp/<workspace-cluster-id>/apis/railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/kubernetesmcps/<name>/mcp
```

- `<workspace-cluster-id>` — kcp logical cluster name for the tenant workspace (from the server URL in the user's kubeconfig)
- `<name>` — name of the `KubernetesMCP` object (usually `default`)

### Request flow

```
AI agent (Claude / Cursor / …)
    │  POST /services/mcp/<cluster>/…/default/mcp
    │  Authorization: Bearer <user-token>
    ▼
hub MCP virtual workspace handler (pkg/virtual/builder/mcp_builder.go)
    │
    │  1. Extract bearer token, validate against kcp
    │  2. Resolve workspace cluster from URL path
    │  3. Fetch KubernetesMCP object for edgeSelector
    │  4. List all edges in the workspace
    │  5. Filter: kubernetes-type only + connected (tunnel active) + label selector
    │  6. Build MultiEdgeRailgridEdgeProvider (one per request)
    │
    ▼
kubernetes-mcp-server (github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server)
    │  MCP Streamable-HTTP protocol (tools/list, tools/call)
    │
    ▼
RailgridEdgeProvider / MultiEdgeRailgridEdgeProvider (pkg/virtual/builder/mcp_provider.go)
    │  GetTargets() → list of connected cluster names
    │  GetDerivedKubernetes(cluster) → rest.Config via revdial tunnel
    │
    ▼
Agent tunnel → target cluster kube-apiserver
```

### Target parameter

When an MCP client wants to target a specific cluster, it passes `?cluster=<edge-name>` as a query parameter. The parameter name is `cluster` (not `edge`) because users think in terms of clusters.

### Toolsets

The MCP server registers toolsets from `kubernetes-mcp-server` via blank imports in `mcp_builder.go`:

```go
_ "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/toolsets/config"
_ "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/toolsets/core"
_ "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/toolsets/helm"
_ "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/toolsets/kcp"
_ "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/toolsets/kiali"
_ "github.com/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server/pkg/toolsets/kubevirt"
```

Each toolset registers its tools via `init()`. Without the blank imports, `tools/list` returns empty.

### Adding to Claude Code

```bash
railgrid mcp url --name default
# prints URL + ready-to-use claude mcp add command with your token
```

Or manually:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http railgrid \
  "https://hub.example.com/services/mcp/<cluster-id>/apis/railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/kubernetesmcps/default/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token-from-kubeconfig>"
```

### Per-edge MCP (single cluster)

Each edge also exposes a direct MCP endpoint (independent of the multi-edge `Kubernetes` resource):

```
https://<hub>/services/agent-proxy/<workspace-cluster-id>/apis/railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/edges/<name>/mcp
```

```bash
railgrid mcp url --edge my-cluster
```

This bypasses the `Kubernetes` MCP resource and connects directly to a single edge's Kubernetes API.
