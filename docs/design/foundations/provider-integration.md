# Provider visual integration and PortalKit distribution

There are two integration modes with one look:

Provider custom elements render in the host document's light DOM, so host
tokens and cascading styles cross the element boundary. Self-contained bundles
namespace their own selectors under railgrid-provider-{name}; that boundary keeps
local rules from leaking while preserving the host-token contract.

1. **Host-compiled** (Infrastructure): `.vue` and `.ts` files are included in
   the host Tailwind scan through `@source` in `main.css`. Utilities, tokens,
   and radius remapping come from the host. A new provider in this mode must be
   added to that source list.
2. **Self-contained** (Code, Kuery, App Studio, Edges, Agents, Databricks, and
   Quickstart): each bundle ships namespaced CSS. Colors use `var(--color-*)`,
   and new fallback literals match the current dark-base values (for example,
   `--color-text-muted` uses `#8587a1`). Existing provider declarations may
   still use the accepted migration fallback `#5d5f78` for that token while
   their bundles migrate independently; it is not the current token and must
   not be copied into new styles. Selectors are under `railgrid-provider-{name}`,
   radii follow the law (or repeat the `--radius-*` overrides), and recipes
   mirror the [shared recipe contract](recipes.md).

PortalKit is canonical in `provider-sdk/portalkit` (vanilla TypeScript and CSS)
and `provider-sdk/portalkit-vue` (Vue SFCs and helpers). Edit canonical files,
then run `make sync-portalkit`; never edit vendored `*/src/portalkit/` copies.
The [PortalKit asset index](../components/portalkit-assets.md) maps every file
distributed by `hack/sync-portalkit.sh` to a contract document.

Standalone bundles call `ensureRailgridUIStyles()`. The helper's
`RAILGRID_UI_CORE_VERSION` and `RAILGRID_UI_CORE_VERSION_MARKER` in
`provider-sdk/portalkit/styles.ts` define the core contract. A host stylesheet is
accepted only when computed root markers include `--railgrid-ui-canonical: 1` and
a compatible core version 32 `--railgrid-ui-core-version`. A stale or unversioned `#k-railgrid-ui`
remains untouched while canonical CSS imported through Vite's `?inline`
loader is appended under a versioned fallback ID with
`data-railgrid-ui-source="portalkit-fallback"`. The runtime fallback may be
minified by Vite; the authored stylesheet and synced source copies remain
byte-identical. Existing style elements are never replaced, and a newer host
stylesheet is never downgraded.

The optional AgentKit workbench tab recipe is canonical in
`provider-sdk/agentkit/agent-ui.css` through the `.k-workbench-tabs`,
`.k-workbench-tab`, `.k-workbench-tab__button`, `.k-workbench-tab__icon`, and
`.k-workbench-tab__label` classes. Both App Studio and Agents consume it: the
recipe defines 32px bordered tabs, 112–240px width bounds, 6px radius, 12px/500
typography, accent active border/background at 40%/10%, and 44px coarse-pointer
sizing. App Studio retains drag, reorder, and close tab lifecycle; Agents uses
fixed Config and Runs tabs. Core PortalKit does not own or load these optional
recipes.

AgentKit is an optional layer. Its independent `AGENT_UI_VERSION` and
`--railgrid-agent-ui-version` marker are owned by `provider-sdk/agentkit/styles.ts`;
core PortalKit does not import AgentKit or imply that its recipes are present.

Agents may request the host's full-bleed layout with a bubbling
`railgrid-layout-change` event while a usable context is on an agent instance
route (`/agents/:name/...`). `ProviderFrame` accepts that boolean for Agents,
and the Agents shell reasserts `fullBleed: true` as the route or host context
changes. The request is cleared when leaving the agent instance, when context
is lost, and when the provider unmounts; it does not change provider routing or
tenant authority.

Provider-owned dialogs may keep their Teleport target inside the provider to
retain scoped styles. While a visible dialog is mounted with `role="dialog"`
and `aria-modal="true"`, the host raises `.railgrid-shell-main` above navigation
using `--k-layer-modal - 2`; hidden dialogs must be unmounted or use `hidden`.
App Studio places its modal backdrop at `--k-layer-modal - 1`, above AgentKit
thread rails and menus. Global confirmations and toasts retain the higher
shared layers. Closing the dialog restores the ordinary host stacking order.
Live Share checks at 932px and 390px in both themes verified dialog hit testing,
focus containment, and restoration of the host layer after Escape.
