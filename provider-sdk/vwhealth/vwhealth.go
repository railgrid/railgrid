// Package vwhealth reports whether a provider can reach the APIExport virtual
// workspace it watches, and turns that into readiness.
//
// Every provider that serves an API to tenant workspaces watches them through
// the URL kcp publishes in APIExportEndpointSlice.status.endpoints[]. That URL
// is copied from Shard.spec.virtualWorkspaceURL — a property of the PLATFORM,
// not of the provider. A provider running somewhere the platform did not
// anticipate (a tenant's own cluster, a kind pod) can therefore find it
// unreachable through no fault of its own: a `127.0.0.1` address means the
// provider's own pod, and an in-cluster service DNS name does not resolve at
// all from outside that cluster.
//
// The failure is silent, which is why this package exists rather than a log
// line. A provider's own resources live in its own workspace and are reached
// over its provider kubeconfig — a different URL that keeps working — so the
// process starts, serves its API, wins leader election, reconciles what is
// local to it, and simply never acts on anything in a tenant workspace. Health
// checks pass throughout. On a real deployment that went unnoticed for days,
// and the eventual symptom pointed nowhere near the cause.
//
// Probing the address, rather than inspecting the multicluster manager, keeps
// the check honest about the thing that actually breaks — whether THIS process
// can reach THAT URL — and does not depend on library internals, which log
// watch failures without surfacing them.
