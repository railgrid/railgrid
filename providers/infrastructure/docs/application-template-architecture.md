# Application template exposure & Gateway API wiring

The `application` template provisions a 3-tier app (frontend + backend +
Postgres) and exposes **only the frontend**, behind oauth2-proxy, on a public
URL. This doc explains how that URL is wired to your cluster's Gateway API
edge and how to configure it.

See also: [credentials.md](credentials.md) (the `cloud-credentials` Secret the
OIDC client secret is bridged from).

## The exposure chain

For each `Application` instance the kro RGD materializes (see
[install/templates/application.yaml](../install/templates/application.yaml)):

```
public host (fqdn)
   │
   ▼
HTTPRoute  ── parentRefs: <RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAME>/<RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE>
   │            hostnames: [expose.fqdn]
   ▼
Service  <name>-oauth : 4180
   │
   ▼
oauth2-proxy  ── OIDC gate (authenticated users only)
   │  --redirect-url=https://<fqdn>/oauth2/callback
   ▼
Service  <name>-frontend : <frontendPort>
```

The backend and Postgres tiers are **never** exposed — they are reachable only
via in-cluster DNS.

There is **no TLS config** on the generated HTTPRoute. The default design
terminates TLS at the Gateway edge (Cloudflare Tunnel via cfgate): the
`cloudflare-tunnel` Gateway reads the HTTPRoute `hostnames` and creates the DNS
record + tunnel route itself. oauth2-proxy runs with
`--reverse-proxy=true --cookie-secure=true` and trusts `X-Forwarded-*` from that
edge. If you front this with a different Gateway you own TLS/DNS yourself — see
"Using a non-Cloudflare Gateway".

## The knobs

All are environment variables on the **provider serve** container.

| Env var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAME` | `cloudflare-tunnel` | Substituted for the reserved `${railgrid.gatewayName}` token in a Template's `backendConfig` before the kro RGD is authored. Ends up as the HTTPRoute `parentRefs[].name`. kro never sees the token — substitution happens in [backend/kro/rgd.go](../backend/kro/rgd.go) (`substituteTokens`). |
| `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` | `cfgate-system` | Same, for the reserved `${railgrid.gatewayNamespace}` token → HTTPRoute `parentRefs[].namespace`. |
| `RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN` | _(unset)_ | The DNS zone apps are served under, e.g. `apps.example.com`. **Also gates the Application instance controller** — see below. |

### `RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN` gates the whole feature

The Application instance controller is **opt-in**. It starts only when BOTH
`RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN` and a runtime kubeconfig (`KRO_KUBECONFIG`, or the
in-cluster runtime) are present
([application_controller.go:37](../application_controller.go#L37)). Without the
base domain it logs `application controller: disabled` and Application
instances never get an fqdn.

The controller computes the public hostname as
([apps/host.go:58](../apps/host.go#L58)):

```
<hostnamePrefix | name>-<tenantHash>.<RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN>
```

and stamps it onto `spec.expose.fqdn`. The RGD then reads
`${schema.spec.expose.fqdn}` for the HTTPRoute `hostnames`, the oauth2-proxy
`--redirect-url`, and the reported `status.url`. The tenant must NOT set `fqdn`
or `credentialsSecretName` by hand — the controller owns both.

So to turn on app exposure you must set **`RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN`**;
`RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAME` / `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` only change *which* Gateway the
HTTPRoutes attach to.

A wildcard DNS record `*.<RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN>` (or per-app records created by
your Gateway, as Cloudflare Tunnel does) must resolve to your Gateway edge.

## Railgrid Auth for the Application API

App Studio can enable Railgrid Auth for a project environment. It stamps
`railgridAuth`, `railgridAuthAppID` (`<ProjectUID>/<environment>`), and the
environment name into the Application instance values from the persisted
project record. The infrastructure Instance controller adds
`railgridAuthInstanceUID` from the tenant Application instance's metadata UID;
it does not use the independently recreated runtime CR UID. These are platform
values; the Application form does not let a tenant choose an identity audience
or reuse a session after deleting and recreating an app instance.

When enabled, the access gate reserves `/__railgrid/auth/login`,
`/__railgrid/auth/identity/callback`, `/__railgrid/auth/session`, and
`/__railgrid/auth/logout`. Login uses the hub's existing Railgrid account
session and returns a short lived, Ed25519 signed app assertion in the
HttpOnly `__Host-railgrid-app-auth` cookie. The gate verifies the exact issuer,
environment audience, signature, and expiry against the hub JWKS. It injects
the verified assertion as `X-Railgrid-App-Identity` only on `/api` requests,
after removing caller-supplied `X-Railgrid-*` headers. The gate strips the
cookie and authorization headers before forwarding; frontend requests never
receive the identity assertion.

`GET /__railgrid/auth/session` returns only normalized user data for the
frontend. `POST /__railgrid/auth/logout` clears the local cookie and requires
the exact app `Origin`; logout does not contact the hub. Anonymous public app
requests remain public. Private apps still require their existing app-access
session around the identity flow. API handlers that require a user must use the
`provider-sdk/auth-node` middleware, which verifies the signed identity and
returns 401 to anonymous callers. The API container receives
`RAILGRID_AUTH_ISSUER`, `RAILGRID_AUTH_AUDIENCE`, and `RAILGRID_AUTH_ORIGIN`
plus `RAILGRID_AUTH_INSTANCE_UID` from platform configuration; these values
override same-named entries in `apiEnv`.

### TLS for the app base domain

With the default Cloudflare Tunnel Gateway, TLS terminates at the Cloudflare
edge (the tunnel gateway), never in the cluster. Every app host has the form
`<prefix>-<12hex>.<baseDomain>`, so the edge needs a certificate covering
`*.<baseDomain>`.

Cloudflare Universal SSL covers only the zone apex and one level below it
(`example.com` and `*.example.com`). When the base domain sits below the zone
apex — for example `bob.railgrid.ai` in the `railgrid.ai` zone — app hosts such as
`web-3f9c2a1b7d4e.bob.railgrid.ai` are two levels deep, and Universal SSL does
not cover them. Each new host then needs its own edge certificate, which
takes minutes to issue: a freshly provisioned instance is Ready, but its URL
fails the TLS handshake until the certificate arrives.

To give new apps working TLS immediately, either:

- configure a wildcard edge certificate for `*.<baseDomain>` (Cloudflare
  Advanced Certificate Manager / Total TLS), or
- use a base domain that is itself the Cloudflare zone apex (a dedicated
  zone), so app hosts are one level below it and Universal SSL covers them.

## Configuring it — by deploy mode

### Legacy chart mode (`operator.enabled=false`)

Set the values; the chart's
[deployment.yaml](../deploy/chart/templates/deployment.yaml) renders them onto
the serve container as `RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN` / `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAME` /
`RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
application:
  baseDomain: apps.example.com   # empty → feature disabled
  gateway:
    name: cloudflare-tunnel      # point at your Gateway
    namespace: cfgate-system
```

```sh
helm upgrade --install infrastructure \
  oci://ghcr.io/railgrid/charts/railgrid-infrastructure-provider --version 0.0.13 \
  --set application.baseDomain=apps.example.com \
  --set application.gateway.name=my-gateway \
  --set application.gateway.namespace=my-gateway-system \
  ...
```

### Operator mode (`operator.enabled=true`)

**This is the mode the production install runs in.** In operator mode the serve
Deployment is built in code by `EnsureProviderServe`
([operator/serve.go](../operator/serve.go)), not by the chart's
`deployment.yaml`, so the exposure config travels through the
`InfrastructureProvider` CR. Set the `operator.application.*` values; the chart's
[operator-config.yaml](../deploy/chart/templates/operator-config.yaml) renders
them into `spec.application` on the CR, and the operator stamps the env vars
onto the serve container:

```yaml
# values.yaml
operator:
  enabled: true
  application:
    baseDomain: apps.example.com   # empty → feature disabled
    gateway:
      name: cloudflare-tunnel      # empty → in-binary default "cloudflare-tunnel"
      namespace: cfgate-system     # empty → in-binary default "cfgate-system"
```

```sh
helm upgrade --install infrastructure \
  oci://ghcr.io/railgrid/charts/railgrid-infrastructure-provider --version 0.0.13 \
  -n railgrid-prod-infrastructure-operator --create-namespace \
  --set operator.enabled=true \
  --set-file operator.providerKubeconfig=./railgrid/provider-infrastructure.kubeconfig \
  --set operator.application.baseDomain=apps.example.com \
  --set operator.application.gateway.name=cloudflare-tunnel \
  ...
```

Equivalently, edit the CR directly:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.railgrid.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureProvider
spec:
  application:
    baseDomain: apps.example.com
    gateway:
      name: cloudflare-tunnel
      namespace: cfgate-system
```

The operator re-reconciles the serve Deployment on the next pass (≤2 min), which
sets `RAILGRID_APP_BASE_DOMAIN` / `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAME` / `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE`
and rolls the pods. Leaving `baseDomain` empty keeps the Application controller
disabled; leaving the `gateway` fields empty falls back to the in-binary
`cloudflare-tunnel` / `cfgate-system` defaults.

> Do **not** `kubectl set env` the serve Deployment by hand — the operator
> overwrites its `spec` on every reconcile (`existing.Spec = want.Spec`), so the
> change is reverted. Configure it on the CR instead.

## Writing exposure into your own templates

Any Template's `backendConfig` can defer the Gateway choice to platform config
by writing the reserved tokens in the HTTPRoute:

```yaml
- id: httpRoute
  template:
    apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: HTTPRoute
    spec:
      parentRefs:
        - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
          kind: Gateway
          name: ${railgrid.gatewayName}            # ← substituted at RGD-author time
          namespace: ${railgrid.gatewayNamespace}  # ← substituted at RGD-author time
      hostnames:
        - ${schema.spec.expose.fqdn}             # ← stamped by the controller
      rules:
        - matches:
            - path: { type: PathPrefix, value: / }
          backendRefs:
            - name: ${schema.spec.name}-frontend
              port: ${schema.spec.frontendPort}
```

`${railgrid.gatewayName}` / `${railgrid.gatewayNamespace}` are the only `${railgrid.*}`
tokens today. They are replaced by a plain string substitution on the
backendConfig JSON before kro parses it, so they are safe to use anywhere a
name is valid. kro's own `${...}` references (`${schema.spec.*}`,
`${someResource.metadata.name}`) pass through untouched.

## Using a non-Cloudflare Gateway

Pointing `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAME` / `RAILGRID_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` at a different Gateway
(nginx-gateway-fabric, Envoy Gateway, Traefik, etc.) only changes the HTTPRoute
`parentRefs`. The shipped `application` template assumes edge TLS and
edge-managed DNS (the Cloudflare model), so for a generic in-cluster Gateway you
also need to:

- Provide DNS for `*.<baseDomain>` → your Gateway's LB.
- Terminate TLS yourself — configure an HTTPS listener with a certificate on the
  Gateway (e.g. cert-manager). The shipped template attaches to whatever listener
  the parent Gateway exposes; the Gateway owns TLS.
- Ensure the Gateway's `allowedRoutes` permits HTTPRoutes from the per-tenant
  namespaces the apps land in (the route is created in the tenant's runtime
  namespace, the Gateway typically in a platform namespace).

oauth2-proxy already trusts forwarded headers (`--reverse-proxy=true`) and sets
secure cookies, so it works behind any TLS-terminating Gateway.
