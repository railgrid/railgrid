// Package appauth is the hub's login-time authorization endpoint for
// published applications.
//
// The design deliberately keeps the hub OFF the per-request data path:
//
//   - Public apps never contact the hub at all.
//   - Private apps redirect an unauthenticated browser here exactly once.
//     The hub reuses the shared portal browser session (or bounces through
//     the normal /login flow), evaluates ONE SubjectAccessReview against the
//     tenant workspace, and hands the app's access proxy a one-use code.
//     The proxy exchanges the code server-to-server and then maintains its
//     own bounded local session; the hub is not consulted again until that
//     session expires.
//   - Non-browser clients (CLIs, CI, agents) exchange their hub bearer AT
//     THE HUB for a short-lived app access token bound to one instance
//     (POST /auth/apps/token) and present that to the app. The proxy asks
//     the hub once (POST /auth/apps/verify), then caches the verdict locally
//     for at most the session TTL. A gate never sees a hub bearer (see
//     apptoken.go and verify.go).
//
// Access policy is plain kcp RBAC in the tenant workspace: visiting a private
// app requires `get` on the instance resource with subresource `access`
// (e.g. `applications/my-shop` + subresource `access`). Granting a member
// access is creating a ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding pair; revoking is
// deleting it. The hub carries no knowledge of any provider CRD schema —
// only resource coordinates supplied by the (controller-authored) proxy
// config, validated syntactically here.
