## railgrid

railgrid: an open-source control plane for platform teams

### Synopsis

railgrid connects Kubernetes clusters and Linux servers behind NAT to one
hub, and gives every team an isolated workspace with its own APIs, RBAC and
providers on top.

Typical session:

  railgrid login --hub-url https://hub.example.com   # OIDC in the browser
  railgrid use                                        # pick an org and workspace
  railgrid edge list                                  # what is connected
  railgrid connect my-cluster                         # point kubectl at an edge
  railgrid ssh my-server                              # shell on a Linux edge
  railgrid whoami                                     # where am I, what can I do

Every command talks to the hub as you, with your workspace RBAC. Run
'railgrid <command> --help' for details and 'railgrid completion --help' for shell
completion.

### Options

```
  -h, --help                       help for railgrid
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify   Skip TLS certificate verification when talking to the hub
      --kubeconfig string          Path to the kubeconfig file (default: $KUBECONFIG, then ~/.kube/config)
```
