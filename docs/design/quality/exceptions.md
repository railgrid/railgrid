# Sanctioned design exceptions

Anything not named here follows the Violet Circuit system. These are product or
technical boundaries, not a debt baseline:

| Exception | Boundary |
|---|---|
| Agents floating Return to latest circle | Explicit user-requested 36px circular scroll control (44px for coarse pointers), scoped to `.agents-return-latest` in `providers/agents/portal/src/style.css`; its zero-height anchor overlays only the button and creates no full-width bar. Other buttons retain the 4px radius. |
| Chat bubbles at 12–14px | Conversational voice, not chrome |
| Terminal canvas colors in `TerminalDock.vue` | Terminals are always dark and read as one intentional dark surface |
| App preview iframe white background | The user's app owns its canvas |
| Third-party brand icon tiles (Google, GitHub, and similar on Dex) | Brand guidelines inside a 20px tile take precedence |
| Kuery graph `RELATION_METADATA` colors | Semantic edge palette, not UI chrome |
| Decorative blurred accent orbs (`blur-[140px]` circles on login/404) | Ambient ground texture below the glow rule's radar |
| Dex auth pages under `hack/dex/web/static/` | Fixed-dark standalone pages pin a local `--railgrid-*` namespace; Dex's light theme hook is retained only for its URL contract and contains no light palette |

The checked-in registry is `hack/ui-conformance-exceptions.json`. Every entry
names one rule, exact repository-relative path, line, column, and source
substring. Its `reference` is the stable catalog ID
`design.quality.exceptions`; `verify-ui-conformance` resolves that ID through
the design catalog, validates the locator against the current source, and
rejects debt, temporary, legacy, or baseline wording. It does not accept a
count baseline or broad path exemption.

The graph's categorical palette remains deliberately explicit because Cytoscape
cannot read CSS variables. Its metadata now supplies theme-specific colors and
non-color line styles, with an automated light-surface contrast floor; the
remaining both-theme, color-blind, browser, and assistive-technology review is
tracked as a [known oddity](known-oddities.md). The exception records the
boundary, not a promise that the palette is universally accessible.

The Agents return-to-latest control is an equal-width/height true circle,
already accepted by the scanner's circle check; it needs no suppressing
registry entry. This documented exception covers its use as a floating
conversation control, not a general circular-button recipe.

## Dashboard customization input boundary

By explicit product-owner decision, dashboard tile movement and resizing use
pointer dragging only. The verbose Move/Make menu actions are intentionally
removed; there is no keyboard or single-click alternative for those operations.
Tile removal remains keyboard-operable through the action menu. This is a
scoped accessibility exception for dashboard arrangement, not a claim of keyboard
or WCAG conformance and not an exception for other resource actions.
