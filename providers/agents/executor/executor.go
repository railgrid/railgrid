// Package executor dispatches background agent work (schedule fires, webhook
// events, channel messages) decoupled from how it is executed. The Executor
// interface is deliberately narrow and the Job payload serializable so the
// in-process implementation can later be swapped for a durable-execution
// engine (Temporal, Restate, ...) by registering the same Handler as an
// activity — without touching the scheduling policy that submits jobs.
