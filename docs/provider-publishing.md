# Publishing providers to standalone mirrors

**Last updated:** 2026-08-14

railgrid is a monorepo, but each provider under `providers/` is also published to
its own standalone, **read-only** GitHub repository. This lets external
consumers depend on (and browse) a single provider without cloning the whole
monorepo — the same pattern Kubernetes uses with its
[`publishing-bot`](https://github.com/kubernetes/publishing-bot) and Symfony/Laravel
use for their components.

Publishing is done with [splitsh-lite](https://github.com/splitsh/lite), which
produces a real, **history-preserving** subtree split (not a squashed
snapshot). splitsh-lite is deterministic: the same source always splits to the
same commit sha1s, so the mirror is append-only and pushes normally
fast-forward.

## What is published

| Provider directory          | Mirror repository                  | Secret                  | Workflow                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `providers/quickstart`      | `railgrid/provider-quickstart`      | `QUICKSTART_DEPLOY_KEY` | [`split-quickstart.yaml`](../.github/workflows/split-quickstart.yaml) |
| `providers/code`            | `railgrid/provider-code`            | `CODE_DEPLOY_KEY`       | [`split-code.yaml`](../.github/workflows/split-code.yaml) |
| `providers/infrastructure`  | `railgrid/provider-infrastructure`  | `INFRA_DEPLOY_KEY`      | [`split-infrastructure.yaml`](../.github/workflows/split-infrastructure.yaml) |
| `providers/app-studio`      | `railgrid/provider-app-studio`      | `APP_STUDIO_DEPLOY_KEY` | [`split-app-studio.yaml`](../.github/workflows/split-app-studio.yaml) |
| `providers/kuery`           | `railgrid/provider-kuery`           | `KUERY_DEPLOY_KEY`      | [`split-kuery.yaml`](../.github/workflows/split-kuery.yaml) |

Each provider has its own workflow (identical except for the provider prefix,
mirror target, trigger paths, and `secrets.*` reference) and its own deploy key — a GitHub deploy key is
scoped to a single repo, so the keys **cannot** be shared across mirrors. See
[Adding another provider](#adding-another-provider) for the generic pattern.

## When it runs

The split workflow triggers on:

- **push to `main`** — mirrors the branch (force-pushed, so the mirror always
  reflects the monorepo even if history is rewritten).
- **pull requests** touching the provider's subtree (or its workflow file) —
  these only *validate* (install splitsh-lite + compute the split); the
  deploy-key and push steps are gated to non-PR events, so a PR never writes to
  a mirror. Provider release tags are handled by the monorepo's
  `provider-release.yaml`; the source mirror remains branch-only so it cannot
  trigger a second image or chart build.
- **`workflow_dispatch`** — manual run, used for the initial seed or a manual
  re-sync.

Runs are serialized per ref (`concurrency` group) and never cancelled
mid-push.

## Publishing inline assistant skill packages

A provider may publish App Studio guidance in
`CatalogEntry.spec.hub.assistantSkills`. This is package distribution, not provider
enablement or authority: the authenticated hub catalog distributes the
validated inline bytes into App Studio's read-only system-skill source. Like
other system skills, a provider package is enabled by default and each project
may disable or re-enable it. The package cannot grant tools, credentials,
permissions, models, approvals, or Provider Actions access.

For each package:

1. Create a package with a `SKILL.md` (YAML `name` and `description` plus the
   guidance body). When useful, start with the bundled
   `skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py` utility, then add only bounded,
   package-relative supporting resources.
2. Validate the package against the provider skill contract: UTF-8 content,
   no traversal or absolute resource paths, no authority-bearing frontmatter,
   and the 32 KiB document / 64 KiB resource / 512 KiB per-provider bounds.
3. Compute the canonical `sha256:` digest over `packageName`, `version`, raw
   `SKILL.md`, and resources sorted by path. Update the digest and version in
   the provider's checked-in `manifest.yaml` (under `spec.hub.assistantSkills`)
   and mirror the complete entry in `deploy/chart/templates/catalogentry.yaml`.
4. If the API contract changes, run the provider code-generation target and
   commit generated schemas. Test that the manifest and Helm CatalogEntry
   render equivalent package name, version, digest, document, and resources;
   do not rely on one copy drifting silently.
5. Link the shipped package's `SKILL.md` from the provider README so its
   authoring contract and operational evidence remain reviewable.

The Databricks provider's shipped example is
[`databricks-app-integration`](https://github.com/railgrid/providers/blob/main/providers/databricks/skills/databricks-app-integration/SKILL.md).

## One-time setup per mirror

These steps are **manual** and must be done once per provider mirror. They
require admin on both the monorepo and the target repo. Substitute the
provider's values from the [What is published](#what-is-published) table for
`<name>` (e.g. `quickstart`), the mirror repo, and the secret name.

> **Each mirror needs its own deploy key.** A GitHub deploy key (the public
> half) can be registered on only one repository — adding a key that is already
> a deploy key on another repo fails with *"Key is already in use."* So you
> cannot reuse one key across `provider-quickstart`, `provider-code`, and
> `provider-infrastructure`; generate a fresh key per mirror.

### 1. Create the target repository

Create the mirror repo (e.g. `railgrid/provider-code`). An empty repo is
fine — the first run creates the `main` branch.

### 2. Generate an SSH deploy key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "railgrid-split-<name>" -f /tmp/<name>_split -N ""
```

This produces a private key (`/tmp/<name>_split`) and a public key
(`/tmp/<name>_split.pub`).

### 3. Add the public key as a write deploy key on the mirror

In **the mirror repo** → **Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key**:

- Paste the contents of `/tmp/<name>_split.pub`.
- **Check "Allow write access".**

A deploy key is scoped to that single repo, which is why we use it instead of a
broad personal access token.

### 4. Add the private key as a secret on the monorepo

In **`railgrid/railgrid`** → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**:

- Name: the provider's secret from the table (e.g. `CODE_DEPLOY_KEY`).
- Value: the full contents of `/tmp/<name>_split` (the private key,
  including the `-----BEGIN/END-----` lines).

### 5. Seed the mirror

Run the workflow once manually: **Actions → Split \<name> provider → Run
workflow**. After the first successful run the mirror tracks the monorepo
automatically.

### 6. Clean up

Delete the local key copies once they are stored in GitHub:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/<name>_split /tmp/<name>_split.pub
```

## How the split works (internals)

Each split workflow (e.g. [`split-code.yaml`](../.github/workflows/split-code.yaml)):

1. Checks out the monorepo with **full history** (`fetch-depth: 0`) — required
   for splitsh-lite to compute the subtree.
2. Downloads the pinned **splitsh-lite `v1.0.1`** prebuilt Linux binary
   (statically bundles libgit2; `v2.0.0` ships no Linux binary and needs cgo,
   so we pin `v1.0.1`). The `v1.0.1` tarball stores the binary as
   `./splitsh-lite` (leading `./`), so the extraction names it explicitly.
3. On non-PR events, writes the provider's deploy-key secret to `~/.ssh` and
   configures `github.com` to use it. (On PRs this step is skipped.)
4. Runs `splitsh-lite --prefix=providers/<name> --origin=HEAD`, which writes the
   split commits into the local object store and prints the tip sha. This runs
   on **every** event (PRs included) so it validates the install + split
   end-to-end without publishing. `--origin` takes a git ref, and `HEAD`
   resolves cleanly for both branch pushes and PR merge commits.
5. On non-PR events, pushes that sha to the mirror's `refs/heads/main` (force).
   Release tags are intentionally not mirrored; `provider-release.yaml` owns
   the versioned image and chart publication from the monorepo tag.

## Adding another provider

All current source-published providers in the table above are wired up. To
publish a new one, copy any existing split workflow (they are identical apart
from the provider prefix, mirror target, trigger paths, concurrency group, and
the `secrets.*` reference) and change:

```yaml
name: Split <name> provider
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'providers/<name>/**'
      - '.github/workflows/split-<name>.yaml'
  workflow_dispatch:
concurrency:
  group: split-<name>-${{ github.ref }}
env:
  PREFIX: providers/<name>                         # the subtree to split
  TARGET_REPO: git@github.com:railgrid/provider-<name>.git
  TARGET_BRANCH: main
  SPLITSH_VERSION: v1.0.1
# ...and reference a per-mirror secret, e.g. secrets.<NAME>_DEPLOY_KEY
```

Then repeat the [one-time setup](#one-time-setup-per-mirror) with a fresh key
and secret name. Use a distinct deploy key + secret per mirror so a leaked key
only affects one repo. (These can later be collapsed into a single matrix
workflow if the list grows.)

## Go module paths

A split mirror keeps the monorepo's `go.mod` verbatim, so a provider's module
path must match its mirror URL for the mirror to be `go get`-able at its own
path. Each published provider's `go.mod` is therefore declared with the mirror
path rather than a monorepo-nested path:

| Provider                   | `module` declaration in `go.mod`              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `providers/quickstart`     | `github.com/railgrid/provider-quickstart`      |
| `providers/code`           | `github.com/railgrid/provider-code`            |
| `providers/infrastructure` | `github.com/railgrid/provider-infrastructure`  |
| `providers/app-studio`     | `github.com/railgrid/provider-app-studio`      |
| `providers/kuery`          | `github.com/railgrid/provider-kuery`           |
| `providers/databricks`     | `github.com/railgrid/provider-databricks`     |

This is transparent to the monorepo because `go.work` references providers by
directory, not by module path, and no other monorepo module imports these
provider modules. When wiring up a new provider mirror, set its `go.mod` module
to the mirror URL (e.g. `github.com/railgrid/provider-code`) before the first
split, and fix up the provider's own in-repo imports of that module path
accordingly (`code` and `infrastructure` each had ~17 self-imports to rewrite).

## Private Planner and Databricks providers

Source and release automation moved to
[railgrid/providers](https://github.com/railgrid/providers). The old Databricks source
mirror is retired after cutover; no source synchronization remains in Railgrid.
Existing public history and previous releases remain available. The Linear
provider that also moved there has since been removed; Planner (one board over
Linear, Jira and GitHub Projects) is its replacement, and the previously
published `railgrid-linear-provider` image and chart versions stay available
but receive no further releases.

Both providers remain platform-installable in Railgrid hubs, using administrator
onboarding, chart bootstrap, CatalogEntry registration and workspace Enable.
Self-hosting is optional. Install the versioned OCI charts
`oci://ghcr.io/railgrid/charts/railgrid-planner-provider` and
`oci://ghcr.io/railgrid/charts/railgrid-databricks-provider`; their images are
`ghcr.io/railgrid/railgrid-planner-provider` and
`ghcr.io/railgrid/railgrid-databricks-provider`. Supply the existing chart kubeconfig
and hub settings. Private source access is not required to install artifacts.

Their `providers/<name>/vX.Y.Z` tags are now created in the private repository,
which verifies before publishing images/charts. The public Railgrid release command
no longer offers those providers. Package Actions access must be granted to the
private repository before its first release without changing package visibility.

The App Studio–Databricks integration suite and dedicated fixtures moved into the
private provider's `test/deferred` directory. Cross-repository adaptation and
execution are deferred; public Railgrid CI does not execute or claim that coverage.
