# FirstRunGuide

## Purpose

For an authoritative first-use empty collection, use `FirstRunGuide.vue` or
matching `k-first-run*` semantic markup in a vanilla portal. It explains the
value, offers the immediate primary action, and shows the shortest meaningful
resource journey. Missing prerequisites change the current step and action;
they do not leave a user at an inert empty table.

## Use when

Use it for an authoritative first-use empty collection. Use the Vue component
or matching `k-first-run*` semantic markup in a vanilla portal.

## Avoid when

Do not leave a first-use collection at an inert empty table. Missing
prerequisites change the current step and action rather than removing the next
meaningful step.

## Anatomy and variants

The guide explains the value, offers the immediate primary action, and shows
the shortest meaningful resource journey. The supported implementations are
`FirstRunGuide.vue` and matching vanilla `k-first-run*` semantic markup.

Step descriptions are optional when the labels explain the journey. The embedded
variant renders just the progress list within an existing creation card, below
the current task heading.

## Behavior

Missing prerequisites change the current step and action. The guide continues
to offer a meaningful next step rather than leaving the user at an inert empty
table.

## Content

Use an eyebrow, a one-line explanation, and one primary action. The copy
explains the value and shortest meaningful resource journey; the primary action
is the immediate next step.

## Layout and responsive behavior

The empty state is an invitation: use a restrained `.contour-grid` texture, an
eyebrow, a one-line explanation, and one primary action. The primary action is
the only solid accent action in the view and follows the shared glow rule.

## Accessibility

The supported vanilla markup is semantic `k-first-run*` markup. Keep the
immediate primary action reachable and identifiable in the empty collection's
accessible structure; this component is not a replacement for the shared
interaction policy.

## Code and evidence

The canonical Vue component is [`FirstRunGuide.vue`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit-vue/FirstRunGuide.vue),
and shared styling lives in [`railgrid-ui.css`](../../../provider-sdk/portalkit/railgrid-ui.css).
Distribution is checked by `make verify-portalkit`.
