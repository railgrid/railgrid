// Package tenant implements the hub-side tenant middleware described in
// docs/organizations.md §Switch the active context. It resolves the active
// Organization + Workspace from request headers (X-Railgrid-Org and
// X-Railgrid-Workspace), validates them against the caller's
// UserMembershipIndex, and stuffs the resolved (user, orgUUID,
// workspaceUUID, role) tuple into the request context for downstream
// handlers to consume.
//
// PR #6 ships the middleware as a library only: the package exposes the
// middleware + context helpers + the UserResolver / MembershipLookup
// interfaces. Wiring it into actual /api/* routes lands in PR #10 when
// the hub-mediated REST surface goes in.

// X-Railgrid-Org without X-Railgrid-Workspace — valid for org-management
// endpoints).

	// admins in every child Workspace, docs/organizations.md O-15); for
