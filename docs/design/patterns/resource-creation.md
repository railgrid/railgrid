# Resource creation journeys

Use a focused, route-owned flow when creating an independently managed resource
or when creation needs prerequisites, sensitive input, multiple meaningful
decisions, or follow-up progress. Use a dialog, drawer, or inline control for a
compact addition whose meaning depends on the current parent. Do not insert a
substantial form into a collection page where it reflows or competes with the
collection.

Organization and workspace member additions, and the current workspace-scoped
service-account creation form, use compact dialogs. Their short identity-and-role
decision does not need a dedicated creation route. Put **Add member** or **Create
service account** in the collection card header; keep creation fields out of the
resting collection so they do not compete with table search. The service-account
case is an explicit exception to the route-owned default for independently
managed resources. Revisit it if creation gains substantial permissions setup,
external prerequisites, multiple steps, or resumable drafts.

Each dialog names the organization or workspace receiving access, uses persistent
field labels, explains the role, and defaults to **Member**. Workspace member
addition explains that access is workspace-only and points to organization
membership management when organization access is intended. Keep validation and
request errors inside the dialog and preserve its draft after a failed request.
On success, close the dialog, refresh the collection without discarding its
search or filters, and confirm the result. Service-account creation does not
automatically issue a secret: **Issue token** remains a separate, deliberate
action. Use the existing dialog focus, keyboard, and responsive conventions.

Choose the surface for the user's task, not field count, API shape, or
implementation convenience. Use the operation's truthful domain verb, such as
**Connect**, **Provision**, or **Deploy**. Use readable provider-owned routes;
avoid collisions between action routes and valid resource identifiers, preferring
`/create/<resource-type>` when detail routes use `/<collection>/:name`.

A route-owned flow has one back action, one title and description, one principal
form surface, and a right-aligned **Cancel → primary action** footer. Simple
forms are constrained; dense provisioning forms may fill the column. Wizards
keep this skeleton and put progress inside it instead of retaining dialog chrome.
Use an ordered list with the shared `k-wizard-steps` recipe for progress labels:
equal-width columns, uppercase mono text, and an accent underline on the item
with `aria-current="step"`. Give the list an accessible progress label. These
labels describe progress, rather than acting as navigation. Edges connection and
Databricks import use this recipe; providers retain ownership of step state and
route-specific layout.

For an authoritative first-use empty collection, use `FirstRunGuide.vue` (or
matching vanilla `k-first-run*` markup). It explains the value, offers the
immediate primary action, and shows the shortest meaningful journey. Missing
prerequisites change the current step and action rather than leaving an inert
empty table.

When domain help is useful, put `CreateGuidance.vue` beside `k-create-fields`
inside `k-create-surface--guided`. The rail contains only timely prerequisites,
a live non-secret summary of what Railgrid will create, and controller-owned next
steps. Provider copy and value derivation remain local. A shared container query
puts fields before guidance on narrow surfaces and keeps both regions fluid at
desktop and 4K widths.

After creation, navigate to the resource when it owns status or recovery;
otherwise return to the collection with the result clearly visible. This is the
target standard; existing flows adopt it incrementally.

Required setup and recommended integrations must be distinguishable. A recommended
integration must offer an explicit skip action and must not block creation while
its connection is missing, validating, or failing. Preserve the creation draft
when the user visits setup or changes the integration choice. App Studio applies
this to Git: model setup is required for the assistant journey, while Git can be
connected later from project settings. Completion copy must describe the services
actually connected, not imply that skipping established a connection.
