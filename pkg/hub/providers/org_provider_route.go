// Hub-originated requests to org-owned providers.

// The backend proxy is not the only thing in the hub that talks to a provider's
// backend on a caller's behalf: the MCP aggregate federates each provider's
// /mcp endpoint itself. For a platform provider that is a direct dial. For an
// org-owned one it must be exactly what serveOverEdge does — the edge hop, and
// a delegated token in place of the caller's bearer — or the aggregate becomes
// the side door around everything proxy_edge.go enforces. OrgProviderRoute
// hands out that same hop and token as an http.RoundTripper, so there is one
// implementation of the boundary, not two.

// OrgProviderRoute is how one hub-originated request reaches one org-owned
// provider's backend on behalf of one caller.
