# Agents portal

Vite + TypeScript + [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) micro-frontend for the agents
provider, mounted in the railgrid portal under `/ui/providers/agents/`. The Go
binary embeds `portal/dist` via `assets.go`.

```
npm install
npm run build      # → portal/dist/main.js (single IIFE bundle, embedded at go build time)
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Host contract

There is **no iframe and no postMessage**. The host
(`portal/src/pages/ProviderFrame.vue`) injects `/ui/providers/agents/main.js`,
which registers the custom element `railgrid-provider-agents`, then appends the
element and assigns a `railgridContext` **property** on it:

```ts
el.railgridContext = { subPath, token, user, tenant, orgUUID, workspaceUUID, theme, basePath }
```

The element renders in **light DOM**, so the portal's `:root` design tokens
cascade in and light/dark themes match without any extra plumbing. Its own
stylesheet (`src/style.css`) is injected once, with every selector namespaced
under `railgrid-provider-agents`.

Tenant objects are read and written straight against kcp on the hub's
`/clusters/<tenant>/…` front door (`src/resources.ts`, portalkit's kube client).
Provider verbs — chat, run, trace, test, … — are kcp custom subresources on
those same objects, addressed with `kubeVerbPath` from `src/portalkit/kube.ts`
(`/clusters/<tenant>/apis/agents.railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/<resource>/<name>/<verb>`)
and fetched through the host-owned transport, which injects the bearer. Only
`/oauth/providers` and `/mcp` still go to `basePath` with `/ui/providers/`
rewritten to `/services/providers/` (the hub's service proxy) — see
`src/portalkit/tenant.ts`. The host context is authoritative for the tenant; the
localStorage copy is only a fallback.

Navigation state lives in `location.hash` (`src/router.ts`), never in the host
router.

## Layout

```
src/
  main.ts               entry: registers the custom element + injects style.css
  element.ts            thin <railgrid-provider-agents> Vue mount boundary
  App.vue               nav, routing, authority rotation, and store lifecycle
  api.ts                typed REST client + a spec-correct SSE reader
  store.ts              Slice<T> {data, loading, error} collections + /api/events subscription
  mutate.ts             the one write helper (optimistic → request → toast → refresh)
  router.ts             hash routes for the four tabs
  types.ts              entity + write DTO types, formatters
  conn-defs.ts          type-driven connection setup guides + shape/inbound derivation
  portalkit/            synced Vue kit + shared tenant/style helpers — edit upstream, not here
  ui/                   framework-neutral toast integration
  vue/                  Vue runtime bridge + framework-neutral chat projection helpers
  views/                Vue components for each surface (agents, agent config/chat, activity,
                        run detail, connections, toolsets, models, automation)
  test/                 vitest component + store tests
```

Four tabs: **Agents** · **Activity** · **Connections** (toolsets are a section)
· **Models**. Schedules and triggers are owned by their agent and edited in the
agent's Config pane, next to a live chat playground.
