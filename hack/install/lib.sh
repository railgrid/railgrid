# Shared environment contract for the hack/install/ scripts.
#
# Every script sources this file. All values can be overridden from the
# environment, so the SAME scripts serve three audiences:
#   * docs/install-external-kcp.md and docs/install-embedded-kcp.md quote
#     these scripts step by step,
#   * developers run them by hand against a local kind cluster,
#   * the e2e suites (test/e2e/suites/installexternal, installembedded)
#     execute them verbatim in CI.
# Keep the scripts and the docs in sync: if you change a step here, update
# the corresponding doc section.

# authenticate at kcp as the wrong user and get 403.

# There is deliberately no fixed default: an install that shipped with a
# well-known token ("dev-token") was reachable by anyone who read the docs.
# Precedence:
#   1. RAILGRID_STATIC_TOKEN set in the environment — used as-is (the e2e suites
#      and CI pin it this way). Nothing is written to disk.
#   2. ${RAILGRID_INSTALL_STATE_DIR}/hub-token exists — reused, so every script
#      of one install (and re-runs of it) agree on the token.
#   3. Otherwise a random token is generated, written to that file (mode 0600)
#      and printed once. teardown.sh removes the state dir, so a fresh install
#      gets a fresh token.
