// Attempt retention.
//
// Every attempt the runner accepts is written to state.json with its receipt,
// its start request and its last cached event, and until now nothing ever took
// one out again. A machine that reviews every webhook delivery of a busy
// repository therefore accumulates hundreds of finished attempts, the file
// grows past what the loader was willing to read, and the runner cannot start
// at all. Retention closes that loop: an attempt that is finished, or parked
// with nobody coming back for it, is dropped after a window, and the number of
// such attempts is capped so a flood cannot outgrow the window.
//
// Dropping an attempt removes everything the runner keeps for it: the state
// records, its event journal, its artifacts and the per-attempt worktree. A
// workspace attempt's directory is shared with every later attempt on that
// workspace and stays; a worktree still leased to a warm environment stays
// until the environment's own expiry releases it.

// verdict in this process, owning a warm environment, running its cleanup hook
// or still owed one: retention only ever takes what the runner is done with.
