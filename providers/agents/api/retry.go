// Retrying unattended runs.
//
// A turn can fail before it runs: the runner the harness lives on is at
// capacity, or is not ready yet. Nothing executed, nobody is holding a
// connection open for the answer, and the condition clears on its own — so
// failing the run and telling a channel "runner execution capacity is full" is
// the wrong answer for a schedule fire or a webhook delivery. Instead the run
// is handed back to the queue it came from: Phase Pending, a RetryAt the Run
// reconciler wakes on, and a Retries count the executor bounds. There is no
// queue besides the Run object and no timer besides the reconciler's computed
// requeue, which is the contract for every unattended run (AGENTS.md §5.8).
//
// The classification is deliberately narrow. What is retried is a REFUSAL the
// runner protocol marks retryable and that carries no receipt — "refused,
// nothing ran", the same distinction every dispatch fence rests on — because
// re-dispatching anything else risks doing work twice: a transport error on
// Start may have started an attempt, and a turn that ran and failed has done
// whatever it did. Those stay terminal, as does anything on an attended run,
// where the person waiting gets the error instead.
//
// The runner has one slot. A queue of refused runs that all wake on the same
// timer is a herd: every wake-up dispatches all of them, one wins, the rest are
// refused again — each refusal a round-trip, a retry spent and a longer wait —
// and the slot sits idle between wake-ups. Two things keep the queue moving at
// the runner's rate instead of the backoff's. A refused run's wake-up is
// staggered by its position in the queue, so runs refused together come back
// one at a time. And when a run on the agent finishes, the oldest queued run
// is woken at once (wakeNextQueued): the slot it needs has just been freed.
// One run, not all — waking them all is the herd again. If something else
// takes the slot first, the woken run is refused and handed back as usual.
