# Typography

Fonts are self-hosted through `@fontsource` and imported in `portal/src/main.ts`.
The portal/provider roles are:

| Surface | Role | Face | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Portal/provider | `font-sans` | Instrument Sans Variable | Body, UI copy, functional headings, KPI numerals |
| Portal/provider | `font-display` (`.type-display`) | Archivo Variable at `font-stretch: 125%` | RAILGRID wordmark and occasional promotional brand surfaces only |
| Portal/provider | `font-mono` | IBM Plex Mono | Identifiers, statuses, badges, table headers, timestamps, code |

Functional page titles—including create/edit forms, resource details, organization
selection, and operational dashboards—use Instrument Sans at normal width and
weight 600 (semibold). Establish hierarchy with size and spacing, not an expanded
face. Shared `.k-create-title` and `.k-resource-page__title` recipes own this
contract. Do not apply `font-display` or `.type-display` to functional headings
or dashboard numerals.

Dex auth is a standalone fixed-dark document. Its local stylesheet embeds only
Instrument Sans Variable (weight range 400–700) for sans copy and IBM Plex Mono
(400, 600, and 700) for technical labels and values. Dex does not embed or
declare Archivo, so the portal's `font-display` role does not apply there. No
other faces and no CDN fonts are allowed.

Standalone status documents rendered by `provider-sdk/statuspage` are a separate
fixed-dark exception. They use the CSS system-font stack (`ui-sans-serif`,
`system-ui`, and monospace fallbacks), with no embedded or external font assets;
this keeps the self-contained auth/callback document usable under its caller's
existing CSP. This exception does not change Dex's self-hosted Instrument Sans
and IBM Plex Mono contract.

The dense scale is explicit: `text-[9px]`–`text-[10px]` for eyebrows, section
labels, and badges (uppercase, tracked, weight 600); `text-[11px]` for nav
items, chips, and small labels; `text-[12px]`–`text-[13px]` for body, table
cells, and buttons; and `text-[14px]`–`text-[19px]` for headings. `.k-kpi` uses
26px Instrument Sans and `tabular-nums`. Numbers aligned in columns always use
`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
