package providers

// Category describes how the portal renders a `spec.category` value in
// the nav and on the providers catalog page. Each entry binds a name
// (matched case-sensitively against CatalogEntry.spec.category) to a
// display label, a lucide-vue-next icon component name, and a sort hint.
//
// Categories not in this list still render — a CatalogEntry can put
// itself in an ad-hoc category like "Observability" — but they fall back
// to the default Puzzle icon and sort after the named ones.
//
// To add a new built-in category: append an entry here, pick a Lucide
// icon name from https://lucide.dev/icons/ (the portal maps the string
// to an imported component in lib/categoryIcons.ts). No portal-side
// change is required unless the icon isn't already imported.
type Category struct {
	// Name is the case-sensitive value that must match
	// CatalogEntry.spec.category for a provider to be grouped here.
	Name string
	// Icon is the lucide-vue-next component name (e.g. "Server",
	// "Sparkles"). Used by the portal as a string lookup; the actual Vue
	// component is resolved client-side.
	Icon string
	// Order is the sort key (ascending). Lower numbers appear higher in
	// the nav. Use multiples of 10 to leave room for future entries.
	Order int
}

// Categories is the canonical list of built-in nav categories. Order
// matters for the default sort; alphabetical-by-display-name kicks in
// only as a tiebreaker between equal Order values.
