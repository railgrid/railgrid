## Overview

The railgrid-hub Helm chart deploys **kcp + railgrid-hub**. In the default embedded-kcp mode it runs as a StatefulSet (kcp's embedded etcd is persisted to a PVC). When `kcp.external.enabled=true`, the hub is stateless and runs as a Deployment instead. This guide covers deploying to both local clusters (kind) and production environments.

For authentication configuration, see [Security]({% link security.md %}).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) | Local Kubernetes cluster |
| [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) | Kubernetes CLI |
| [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) v3+ | Package manager |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) | Container runtime |

---

## Deploying to kind

### 1. Create a kind cluster

```bash
kind create cluster --name railgrid
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-railgrid
```

### 2. Build and load the hub image

```bash
make docker-build-hub
kind load docker-image ghcr.io/railgrid/railgrid-hub:$(git describe --tags --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo dev) --name railgrid
```

{: .note }
The kcp image is pulled from its public registry (`ghcr.io/kcp-dev/kcp`).

### 3. Create a values file

Create `values-kind.yaml`:

```yaml
hub:
  hubExternalURL: "https://localhost:9443"
  devMode: true
  staticAuthToken: "<generate-with-openssl-rand-hex-32>"
```

For OIDC authentication instead of static token, see [Security]({% link security.md %}).

### 4. Install the chart

```bash
helm upgrade --install railgrid deploy/charts/railgrid-hub/ \
  -f values-kind.yaml \
  --namespace railgrid-system \
  --create-namespace
```

### 5. Wait for pods to be ready

```bash
kubectl -n railgrid-system get pods -w
```

Wait until `railgrid-railgrid-hub-0` is Running with all containers ready:

```bash
kubectl -n railgrid-system wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=railgrid-hub --timeout=120s
```

{: .note }
The hub container waits for kcp to generate `admin.kubeconfig` before starting (30-60 seconds).

### 6. Port-forward and log in

```bash
kubectl -n railgrid-system port-forward svc/railgrid-railgrid-hub 9443:9443
```

In another terminal:

```bash
railgrid login \
  --hub-url https://localhost:9443 \
  --token <your-static-token> \
  --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

---

## Production Deployment

For production, you need:

1. **Public ingress** — So remote agents can connect (see [Ingress]({% link ingress/index.md %}))
2. **Proper TLS** — Via cert-manager or your own certificates
3. **Authentication** — Static token or OIDC (see [Security]({% link security.md %}))
4. **Trusted proxies** — `hub.trustedProxyCIDRs` set to the ingress/load-balancer ranges, so the hub's per-client rate limits see real client addresses instead of the proxy's (without it every client shares one bucket)

### Example production values

```yaml
hub:
  hubExternalURL: "https://hub.example.com"
  devMode: false

  # Choose one authentication method:
  staticAuthToken: "<token>"  # Simple
  # OR use idp section for OIDC

  tls:
    selfSigned:
      enabled: false
    certManager:
      enabled: true
      issuerRef:
        name: letsencrypt-prod
        kind: ClusterIssuer
      dnsNames:
        - "hub.example.com"

# For OIDC (optional)
idp:
  issuerURL: "https://idp.example.com"
  # Optional for split-horizon IdPs:
  # browserAuthURL: "https://login.example.com/oauth2/auth"
  clientID: "railgrid"
  clientSecret: "<secret>"

ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: "cloudflare-tunnel"  # or nginx, traefik, etc.
  hosts:
    - host: hub.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```

### Turning on the hardened defaults early

Three provider-facing hub flags shipped in this release with deliberately soft
defaults so providers installed from older charts keep working while they are
rolled forward; the next release flips each one. The chart leaves all three
unset by default (nothing is rendered, the binary default applies), and
`hub.security` lets you move to the hardened posture now instead of waiting
for the flip. Recommended production values, safe with every provider this
release ships:

```yaml
hub:
  security:
    # Reject provider heartbeats not signed by that provider's own service
    # account (binary default this release: warn). Needs every provider on a
    # chart that sends its service-account token as the heartbeat bearer.
    providerHeartbeatAuth: enforce
    # Hand platform providers a short-lived workspace-scoped token instead of
    # the caller's own hub bearer (binary default: off). Org-owned providers
    # are always delegated. `edges` stays excluded unless you replace the
    # list with providerDelegatedTokensExclude.
    providerDelegatedTokens: platform
```

The third flag, `providerWorkspaceClusterAdmin`, is deliberately not in that
snippet. It binds provider service accounts to the narrow generated
`railgrid:provider` ClusterRole instead of cluster-admin in their own workspace,
and the infrastructure provider defines and serves its own CRDs from its
provider workspace, which the narrow role does not grant. Leave it unset (or
`true`) while you run the infrastructure provider. Once you have confirmed
that none of your providers needs cluster-admin in its workspace, flip it
separately:

```yaml
hub:
  security:
    # Only once your providers are verified: the hub replaces the binding in
    # place, and setting this back to true restores cluster-admin.
    providerWorkspaceClusterAdmin: false
```

Watch your providers after that upgrade. Flags the chart does not model yet
go in `hub.extraArgs` (for example `["--providers=edges,infrastructure"]`);
the chart refuses an entry that repeats a flag it already renders from a
value.

## Scaling the hub

The hub runs as a single-replica StatefulSet by default because embedded kcp
keeps its etcd on a per-replica PVC — each replica would be its own control
plane. Scaling requires external kcp:

```yaml
kcp:
  embedded:
    enabled: false
  external:
    enabled: true
    existingSecret: railgrid-kcp-kubeconfig

replicaCount: 3
```

With `kcp.external.enabled=true` the chart renders a `Deployment` with a
`RollingUpdate` strategy. The chart refuses `replicaCount > 1` alongside
embedded kcp rather than rendering something that cannot work.

Every replica serves the full request surface — API proxy, portal, provider
proxies — and no request is pinned to a pod, so no session affinity is
needed on the ingress. Three pieces of hub state are what make that true:

- **Singleton controllers** (provider provisioning, MCPServer, organization
  bootstrap, soft-delete) run only on the replica holding the
  `railgrid-hub-controllers` Lease in `root:railgrid:system:controllers`. The provider
  *catalog* controller is deliberately exempt: it maintains the routing table
  the request path reads, so it runs everywhere.
- **Browser sessions and published-app authorization codes** live in
  kcp-backed Secrets in the same workspace, so a cookie minted by one replica
  resolves — and revokes — on all of them.
- **Provider heartbeats** are recorded on `CatalogEntry.status`, so liveness
  observed by the replica that received the beat reaches the others over the
  catalog watch instead of each replica timing the provider out on its own.

One thing costs more per replica rather than less:

- The per-IP auth rate limiter is per replica, so N replicas admit up to N times
  the configured burst. Enforce a hard global bound at the ingress if you need
  one.

## Operations

### Checking Logs

```bash
# kcp container
kubectl -n railgrid-system logs railgrid-railgrid-hub-0 -c kcp

# hub container
kubectl -n railgrid-system logs railgrid-railgrid-hub-0 -c hub
```

### Upgrading

```bash
helm upgrade railgrid deploy/charts/railgrid-hub/ \
  -f values.yaml \
  --namespace railgrid-system
```

{: .note }
TLS secrets have `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` and survive upgrades.

### Uninstalling

```bash
helm uninstall railgrid --namespace railgrid-system
```

This preserves PVCs (kcp data) and TLS secrets. To fully clean up:

```bash
kubectl -n railgrid-system delete pvc --all
kubectl -n railgrid-system delete secret railgrid-railgrid-hub-tls
kubectl delete namespace railgrid-system
```

To also remove the kind cluster:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name railgrid
```

### Hub Configuration

| Key | Description | Default |
|:----|:------------|:--------|
| `hub.hubExternalURL` | **(required)** External URL for kubeconfigs and callbacks | `""` |
| `hub.internalURL` | Address in-cluster components use to reach the hub (baked into minted provider kubeconfigs). Set to the in-cluster Service so provider pods don't hairpin through the public hostname | `""` (falls back to `hubExternalURL`) |
| `hub.listenAddr` | Hub listen address | `":9443"` |
| `hub.devMode` | Skip TLS verification for OIDC issuer | `false` |
| `hub.staticAuthToken` | Static bearer token (bypasses OIDC) | `""` |
| `hub.softDeleteGracePeriod` | How long a deleted user, organization or workspace stays recoverable before the hub purges it (Go duration, e.g. `72h`). Unset leaves the binary default | `""` (binary: `720h`, 30 days) |

### Identity Provider

| Key | Description | Default |
|:----|:------------|:--------|
