	IDPBrowserAuthURL string
	IDPClientID       string
	// DisableTokenLogin removes the interactive static-token login: the
	// /auth/token-login endpoint is not registered and /healthz advertises
	// tokenLogin=false so the portal hides its token form. Static bearer
	// tokens keep authenticating API/MCP/CLI calls — only the browser login
	// path is disabled. Use with OIDC so humans sign in with a username and
	// password at the IdP.
	DisableTokenLogin bool
	// PublishedAppsDomain is deprecated and ignored. The published-app
	// authorize/exchange endpoints are always mounted, and sign-in redirects
	// are pinned per request to the host stamped on the instance being
	// authorized — so apps under BYO provider zones and customer-owned
	// domains need no hub-side domain configuration. The flag is kept only
	// so existing deployments that pass it keep starting.
	PublishedAppsDomain string
	// IDPCAFile is a path to a PEM-encoded CA bundle used to verify the IdP's
	// TLS certificate. Required when IDPIssuerURL is https and uses a cert
	// not signed by a system trust anchor (e.g. the dev Dex deployment).
	IDPCAFile       string
	ServingCertFile string
	ServingKeyFile  string
	HubExternalURL  string
	// HubInternalURL, when set, is the address in-cluster components use to
	// reach this hub instead of HubExternalURL. It is baked into minted provider
	// kubeconfigs and offered as the "internal" option by the admin kubeconfig
	// download.
	//
	// Without it, a provider pod's calls to the hub resolve the public hostname,
	// leave the cluster, and re-enter through whatever fronts it (CDN, tunnel,
	// load balancer) — for a provider running beside the hub that is a pointless
	// round trip that also makes the whole platform look like one noisy client
	// IP to the edge.
	//
	// Typically the hub's in-cluster Service
	// (https://<release>-railgrid-hub.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9443). Also
	// useful when provider pods reach the hub at a different address than
	// browsers do — e.g. a kind pod dialing https://host.docker.internal:9443
	// while browsers use https://localhost:9443. Leave empty when providers run
	// outside the cluster.
	HubInternalURL   string
	DevMode          bool
	StaticAuthTokens []string

	// TrustedProxyCIDRs lists the address ranges of the reverse proxies that
	// front this hub (ingress controller, load balancer, CDN egress). The
	// pre-authentication rate limiters (token-login, /auth/refresh, the
	// published-app code exchange, the aggregate MCP bearer check) key their
	// buckets on the client address, and a proxy's X-Forwarded-For is only
	// believed when the connection peer is inside one of these ranges — see
	// proxy.ClientIP for the exact rule.
	//
	// Empty (the default) means proxy headers are ignored and every request is
	// keyed on its connection peer. A hub deployed behind a proxy without this
	// set therefore sees all of its clients as the proxy's own address and
	// throttles them as one; that is the safe failure, so set it. Never widen
	// it to ranges clients can connect from: any peer inside it can pick its
	// own bucket by sending X-Forwarded-For.
	TrustedProxyCIDRs []string

	// ProviderDelegatedTokens selects which providers receive a short-lived,
	// workspace-scoped ServiceAccount token in place of the caller's own hub
	// bearer on the backend proxy (/services/providers/{name}/*). Org-owned
	// providers always receive the delegated token regardless of this
	// setting; it governs platform providers only:
	//
	//   off      — platform providers receive the caller's bearer as-is
	//              (the historical behaviour).
	//   platform — platform providers receive the delegated token, except
	//              the names in ProviderDelegatedTokensExclude.
	//   all      — every platform provider receives the delegated token;
	//              the exclusion list is ignored.
	//
	// Default "off" for this release. The next release defaults to
	// "platform"; deployments should run "platform" ahead of that to
	// confirm their providers need nothing beyond /clusters/{id} access.
	ProviderDelegatedTokens string
	// ProviderDelegatedTokensExclude names platform providers that keep
	// receiving the caller's bearer under ProviderDelegatedTokens=platform.
	// Defaults to providers.DefaultDelegationExclude.
	ProviderDelegatedTokensExclude []string

	// ProviderHubAccessPlatformDefault lets a platform provider use the hub
	// capabilities it declares (CatalogEntry.spec.hub.access) in a workspace
	// where no tenant decision was recorded yet. Platform providers are
	// operator-installed and, under ProviderDelegatedTokens=off, hold the
	// caller's own bearer anyway; this keeps them working across the upgrade
	// to the hub-access contract. An explicit decision (Enable with or
	// without accepting) always wins, and org-owned providers always need
	// one. Set false to require acceptance for every provider.
	ProviderHubAccessPlatformDefault bool

	// AdminUsers is the allowlist of platform-admin identities permitted to
	// reach the /api/admin/* surface and the portal's /bonkers area. Each entry
	// matches a User CR by name, email, or rbacIdentity (case-insensitive).
	// Empty disables the admin surface entirely.
	AdminUsers []string

	// Providers is the list of first-party builtin providers to materialize
	// into root:railgrid:providers at bootstrap. The flag accepts a comma-
	// separated list or repeats; see cmd/railgrid-hub/main.go for the default.
	// Empty/nil enables every known builtin (kcp.BuiltinProviderNames()).
	// Dependencies between builtins are validated at hub startup — see
	// pkg/hub/kcp.builtinEntries[].Requires.
	Providers []string

	// ProviderHeartbeatAuth is what the hub does with a provider heartbeat
	// whose bearer token does not verify as that provider's own service
	// account: "warn" logs and records the beat, "enforce" rejects it. The
	// default is "warn" for this release so providers installed from charts
	// that predate the authenticated heartbeat keep reporting alive while
	// they are rolled forward; the next release flips the default to
	// "enforce". See providers.HeartbeatAuthMode.
	ProviderHeartbeatAuth string
	// ProviderWorkspaceClusterAdmin selects the role the provider ServiceAccount
	// is bound to inside its own provider workspace: true (the default this
	// release) keeps cluster-admin, false binds the generated, narrower
	// railgrid:provider ClusterRole.
	//
	// The default is the wide one for one release so an operator can stage the
	// change — flip it, watch their providers, flip back if one of them needed
	// a right the narrow role does not grant (the infrastructure provider, which
	// serves its own CRDs from this workspace, is the known case). The NEXT
	// release defaults this to false. Flipping either way replaces the existing
	// binding: RoleRef is immutable, so the hub deletes and recreates it.
	ProviderWorkspaceClusterAdmin bool

	// PortalDevURL, when set, reverse-proxies /ui/* to this URL (typically
	// a Vite dev server, e.g. http://localhost:3000). Takes precedence over the
	// embedded portal dist (if built with -tags portal_embed).
	PortalDevURL string
	// PortalFrameSources are additional CSP frame-src source expressions allowed
	// by the portal. Keep this narrow; provider UIs are still same-origin through
	// the hub, while platform-owned preview hosts can be added explicitly.

	// KCPShardExternalURL is the URL kcp publishes into APIExportEndpointSlice

	// Empty defaults to kcp's auto-detected external address, which for an
	// embedded kcp bound to 127.0.0.1 is "https://127.0.0.1:6443" — fine for
	// host-side clients, broken for clients running in a kind pod (they

	// "https://host.docker.internal:6443" for kind-based dev setups.
	KCPShardExternalURL string

	// status.endpoints[]. For a single-shard embedded dev setup both want
	// the same value.
