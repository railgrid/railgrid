// Package mcpserver exposes kuery's fleet query surface to AI agents:
// kuery_query (full QuerySpec passthrough) and kuery_impact (one object →
// its declared-coupling blast radius). One structured query against the
// local index replaces N kubectl round-trips through N edge tunnels —
// the primary practical justification for the provider (see
// docs/kuery-provider-architecture.md in the railgrid repo).
//
// Mirrors the infrastructure provider's pattern: a stateless streamable HTTP
// handler building a per-request server, so each caller's request — its bearer
// and the workspace the aggregate addressed — is closed over in the tool
// handlers. Every tool call goes through queryapi.RunHandler.RunSavedView, the
// same gated executor the REST verb uses, so an MCP caller is held to exactly
// the same two gates as a browser: they must be able to see the SavedView they
// name, and they must be granted the run verb on it.
