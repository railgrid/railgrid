# App Studio development runtime

Status: **current runtime boundary**.

App Studio's development environment is **Template-backed**. A Project records
the selected infrastructure `Template`; the Template's development contract
declares its instance resource and one or more development components. App
Studio does not assume a `SandboxRunner` kind, a single container, or a fixed
toolchain. The selected Template is provisioned with `railgridMode: development`
and its own graph owns the runtime namespace, workloads, services, routes, and
development-agent configuration.

The retained [`app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md`](./app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md)
document is a design proposal and historical rationale. It is not the current
API contract; this document describes the boundary implemented by App Studio.

## Product and provider responsibilities

App Studio owns the product-facing pieces:

- the Project and its tenant-scoped workspace files
- selecting or switching the development Template
- the `/api/projects/*` development endpoints and assistant runtime tools
- routing workspace files to the Template's declared component paths
- authorizing a preview URL and reporting edge readiness

The infrastructure provider owns the runtime graph and data plane. It resolves
the selected instance's declared data-plane contract and, using its own
runtime-cluster credential, serves control operations and preview proxying. App
Studio acts as the requesting tenant user; it does not hold a kubeconfig or
service credential for the infrastructure provider's runtime cluster.

## Development component topology

Each development component pod has three non-root containers. The public,
token-authenticated App Studio → Infrastructure control contract remains on the
component Service's `7070` control port and `7071` exec port, using
`X-Sandbox-Control-Token`. The coordinator owns that contract and durable
session/idempotency state on a separate per-component platform-state PVC
mounted at `/railgrid/state`; it has no app environment or secrets.

The app runtime supervisor owns the app environment/secrets and starts or
restarts the app, but has no platform token or platform-state mount. The
stateless executor verifies workspace source revision and SHA-256 digest before
running typed argv; it has no platform token, platform-state mount, app
environment/secrets, or service-account credentials. Their internal control
surfaces bind only to pod loopback: runtime supervisor `7072`, executor `7073`.

All three containers run as UID/GID `1000`, with
`allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` and all capabilities dropped. The pod uses
seccomp `RuntimeDefault`, `fsGroup: 1000`, and `shareProcessNamespace: false`.
When a Template declares `reload.strategy: container`, the runtime supervisor
container is restarted; the coordinator remains running.

That profile still shares the host kernel with the node. The infrastructure
provider therefore accepts a platform-configured RuntimeClass
(`RAILGRID_SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CLASS_NAME`, chart value `sandbox.runtimeClassName`,
`InfrastructureProvider.spec.sandbox.runtimeClassName`) and stamps it as
`spec.runtimeClassName` on every synthesized development pod, including the
universal coding sandbox. It is a platform decision, never a Template schema
field: an empty `runtimeClassName` is an invalid PodSpec, and a per-instance
field would let a tenant opt out of the isolation the operator mandated. The
expected values are `gvisor` (gVisor/runsc) or `kata` (Kata Containers);
installing the runtime and its RuntimeClass on the nodes is cluster-dependent.

## Development data plane

For a Project with `spec.template`, App Studio reads the Template and resolves
the instance resource (`spec.instanceCRD`) plus its development components.
Each workspace file is routed by the component's `workspacePath`; a component
sync is a call to the infrastructure provider's declared `sync` verb — a kcp
custom subresource on `instances` — made by App Studio **as itself** through
its own APIExport virtual workspace, on the claim its `spec.requires`
declaration generates (`Callers.ExportVerbURL`):

```text
POST {vw}/clusters/{workspace}/apis/infrastructure.railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/instances/{name}/sync
POST {vw}/clusters/{workspace}/apis/infrastructure.railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/instances/{name}/sync?component={component}
```

The same data-plane boundary serves `restart`, `log`, `env`, and `process`
operations. kcp forwards the request to infrastructure under App Studio's
identity; the provider's gate recognises the foreign provider the claim
authorized, reads the published instance as itself, and only then reaches its
private runtime services. End-user identity is not carried across. Deleting
or switching a Template deletes the old instance; the provider's resource
graph owns runtime cleanup.

This is the platform
[provider-isolation rule](./providers.md#provider-isolation-the-cross-provider-boundary):
App Studio reaches infrastructure-owned workloads only through the published
instance API and data-plane subresources. It never resolves or calls a provider
backend URL directly, so a tenant can be backed by a different infrastructure
provider/runtime cluster without an App Studio-specific credential.

## Preview authorization and readiness

`POST /api/projects/{project}/authorize-development-preview` reads the selected
instance's `status.url`. A URL is a candidate only; App Studio probes the
public edge (DNS, TLS, and Gateway routing) before returning `ready: true`.
While the edge is provisioning it returns `ready: false`, a stable reason, and
a human-readable message. The portal retries that authorization until the edge
responds and then renders the Template's normal public route.

The current Template preview is **not** an App Studio-signed preview token or a
companion `SandboxPreviewHTTPRoute`. The URL is the instance's ordinary
exposure route, and browser traffic goes directly to that route. The
`APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` setting only permits a local
self-signed Gateway during the readiness probe; it does not change production
certificate verification.

## Capability boundary

App Studio should depend only on the published capabilities it needs:

- component-aware `sync`
- bounded, revision/digest-checked `exec`
- `restart`, `log`, `env`, and `process` data-plane verbs where the Template
  declares them
- instance status from the tenant API
- preview URL authorization plus edge readiness

The infrastructure provider keeps runtime service names, namespaces, control
tokens, and runtime-cluster credentials private. Its data-plane resolver
validates status references and authorizes the caller before proxying, so stale
or forged status cannot redirect App Studio to arbitrary runtime services.

## Current security caveats

Development runs user-generated code. With the default (empty)
`sandbox.runtimeClassName` this remains a development-oriented runtime, not a
complete untrusted-code sandbox. Before exposing App Studio to untrusted
users, set `sandbox.runtimeClassName` to a hardened RuntimeClass (`gvisor` or
`kata`) that is installed on the runtime cluster; it is required, not
optional, for that use. Quota defaults, image provenance controls, and
restrictive network policy remain additional work. File sync remains
text-file oriented and skips binary or oversized App Studio workspace files.
