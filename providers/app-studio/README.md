App Studio is a railgrid provider that gives each tenant a **persistent AI project
workspace**: named Projects with durable "memory" (goals / requirements /
constraints) and a chat surface backed by the tenant's own LLM credentials,
with optional MCP tool use against their workspace. Projects are stored as
`projects.ai.railgrid.ai` resources in the tenant's own kcp workspace; chat
transcripts persist in the provider's message store (Postgres in production and
local dev, with explicit in-memory mode available only for throwaway UI work).

Every tenant-facing call is a **data-plane verb**: a kcp custom subresource
`{resource}/{verb}` App Studio publishes on its APIExport, reached on the hub's
kcp front door like any other API path —
`/clusters/{id}/apis/ai.railgrid.ai/v1alpha1/{projects|sessions|studios}/{name}/{verb}`.
kcp authenticates the caller, authorizes the HTTP method as the RBAC verb on
the coordinate, and reverse-proxies the request here with the caller's identity
stamped in `X-Remote-*` headers; there is no hub-proxied grammar and **no
caller bearer**. After the gate (a `SubjectAccessReview` on the caller's behalf
proving they may see the addressed object), a handler acts **as the provider**
through App Studio's APIExport virtual workspace (see `tenant/`); any further
question about the caller is another access review, never a caller-scoped
client. The actor recorded on threads, attachments, approvals and audit rows is
the kcp-authenticated user. The organization / workspace UUIDs that key App
Studio's durable state, and the tenant path handed to a project's Provider
Actions identity, are read from kcp (the workspace's `APIBinding` for this
export, through the virtual workspace) rather than parsed from a header.

## Start with or without Git

Onboarding requires an AI model connection. Git is recommended, with an explicit
**Skip for now** action. Projects without Git support assistant authoring and
development previews; their source resides in App Studio workspace storage.
The chart uses persistent storage by default. Operators upgrading from
`emptyDir` must follow the [workspace migration procedure](deploy/chart/README.md#workspace-persistence-and-upgrades).

Connect later from **Project settings → Git → Create repository and save project
files**. This creates a new private repository through the Code provider and
queues current source for persistence when the project is idle. Provisioning,
commit failures, and pending source are separate states; binary or oversized
files may remain only in App Studio. Connecting a workspace account does not
automatically attach existing projects. History restore, commits, and Git-based
production builds require a connected repository.

Both `POST /api/projects` and `/api/projects/stream` accept `repositoryMode`:
`auto` (default) uses a validated connection when available; `none` avoids Code
entirely; `create` requires Git. Explicit `connectionRef` or
`existingRepositoryRef` still requires Git and cannot accompany `none`.
Unexpected connection-discovery errors are returned; an explicit `none` request
can proceed independently. `PUT /api/projects/{project}/repository` accepts
`connectionRef`, reuses the binding on retries, and refuses repository replacement.

## What's here

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| Provider binary | `main.go` — loads the provider kubeconfig, opens the message store, mounts `/api` + the embedded portal, heartbeats the hub |
| REST / LLM / message API | `api/` — Project CRUD, memory, LLM settings, streaming chat (`/api/projects/*`) |
| API types | `apis/ai/v1alpha1/` — the `Project`, `Session`, and `Studio` CRD types (deepcopy generated) |
| Typed client | `client/` — trimmed dynamic client for the Project resource |
| Tenant client | `tenant/` — token-forwarding `ClientFactory` (host+TLS from the provider kubeconfig, caller token per request) |
| Cross-provider reach | `internal/crossprovider/` — the dependency coordinates and the requirements the reconcilers are granted; `controller/{project,studio}/identity.go` mint it, `controller/tenantwatch/` watches with it |
| Message store | `store/` — Postgres + in-memory + envelope-encryption implementations |
| Development runtime | `api/development_*` + `api/dataplane_client.go` — template-selected development instances, component-aware sync, restart/log/status calls, and edge-checked preview authorization |
| Portal | `portal/` — the Vue micro-frontend (`<railgrid-provider-app-studio>`), embedded via `assets.go` |
| Registration | `manifest.yaml` — CatalogEntry: `spec.export` (the `ai.railgrid.ai` APIExport with `projects`, `sessions` and `studios` and the verbs on each), `spec.requires` (one entry per API group: Infrastructure, Code, `authorization.k8s.io`, and the label-selected core `secrets`), `spec.serving` and `spec.hub` |
| Deploy | `deploy/chart/` — Helm chart (Deployment, Service, CatalogEntry) |
| CI (mirror) | `.github/workflows/{image,chart}.yaml` — publish the image + chart to GHCR (run only in the mirror) |

## Skills

The project portal includes a first-class **Skills** workbench. It presents the
installed catalog as a searchable grid, marks enabled skills, and opens a
focused detail view with author-visible instructions, supporting-resource
metadata, and an Enable or Disable action. The portal intentionally does not
offer skill creation, import, editing, export, or deletion. Bundled skill
content is read-only; project packages live under `.agents/skills`, with
activation metadata in `.agents/skills/.railgrid-catalog.json`.

Every package must contain a `SKILL.md` whose YAML frontmatter includes the
required `name` and `description` fields. Skill bodies and supporting resources
are untrusted guidance: they cannot grant tools, permissions, models, approval
bypasses, or override system/tool policy. App Studio reads bundled skills,
authenticated provider-inline packages, and project packages; there is no
remote skill registry. Provider packages are read-only system skills qualified
as `providers/<provider>/<packageName>`.

Provider package distribution and provider/action enablement are separate. A
validated `CatalogEntry.spec.hub.assistantSkills` entry is distributed through the
authenticated hub `/api/providers` catalog. It follows the system-skill default
of enabled, and each project may disable or re-enable it. The package's version
and canonical `sha256:` digest are retained in the same catalog snapshot used
for metadata discovery, progressive `load_skill`/`read_skill_resource`,
activation, and turn receipts. Provider readiness is not skill authority: a transient
heartbeat/readiness change does not revoke declared guidance. A missing bearer
or transient provider-catalog failure leaves bundled and project skills
available and emits only a bounded sanitized warning where applicable.
Provider Actions and grants remain authoritative and fail closed; skill text
cannot widen them.

For each `Default`, `Plan`, or `Review` turn, catalog discovery exposes metadata
for enabled skills and the model selectively invokes the assistant's native
durable read tools: `load_skill` loads one qualified skill and
`read_skill_resource` reads a bounded package-relative resource only after that
skill is loaded. Those invocations appear in the same action pane as other tool
calls, using lifecycle labels such as `Loading skill` and `Loaded skill` while
showing only the qualified skill ID.

Skill selections are pinned to a catalog digest with bounded digest/content
receipts. Skill lifecycle, selection, load, resource, and drift metrics use
fixed outcome labels and do not include skill IDs, package paths, tenant IDs,
request bodies, or resource paths.

The HTTP surface is:

```text
GET    /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills                         catalog metadata
GET    /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/detail?id={qualifiedID} author-visible detail
POST   /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/project                 create
POST   /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/project/import          import
GET    /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/project/{packageName}   inspect
PUT    /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/project/{packageName}   edit
DELETE /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/project/{packageName}   delete
GET    /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/project/{packageName}/export export
POST   /api/projects/{project}/assistant/skills/activation              enable/disable
```

The project lifecycle endpoints remain available for programmatic management,
but they are not currently exposed as portal authoring controls. Turn and
review requests continue to accept an optional `skills` field for API clients;
the portal no longer presents a per-turn selector or sends that field.

## Configuration

Environment variables consumed by the binary:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Listen port (default `8081`) |
| `RAILGRID_HUB_URL` | Hub base URL for the hub's own REST API (provider catalog, membership rosters, browser-session handoff) and the workspace MCP aggregate, called as the provider with its hub token |
| `RAILGRID_HUB_PUBLIC_URL` | Browser-reachable HTTPS hub origin for private preview authorization redirects and one-use browser-session handoffs; may differ from the internal `RAILGRID_HUB_URL`, and private browser inspection fails closed when unset or invalid |
| `RAILGRID_HUB_TOKEN` | Bearer token for the heartbeat |
| `RAILGRID_PROVIDER_NAME` | CatalogEntry name (default `app-studio`) |
| `RAILGRID_PROVIDER_KUBECONFIG` | Provider kubeconfig (kcp front-proxy host + TLS only) |
| `RAILGRID_ACTIONS_EXTERNAL_URL` | Optional absolute HTTPS hub origin, reachable and certificate-valid from sandbox pods, injected into action-enabled development runtimes for workload-token exchange and the declared server-side Actions SDK gateway calls; no local default |
| `RAILGRID_ACTIONS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` | Optional PEM file containing the public CA for that origin; passed only to action-enabled development runtimes, never used to disable TLS verification |
| `RAILGRID_ACTIONS_CA_BUNDLE` | Optional direct PEM equivalent for local launches; when both CA settings are present they must match |
| `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN for the message store |
| `APP_STUDIO_IN_MEMORY_MESSAGE_STORE` | `true` → non-durable in-memory store (dev) |
| `APP_STUDIO_CONTROLLER_MODE` | Controller lifecycle policy: `required` requires the multicluster controller to become ready; `rest-only` intentionally disables it for local REST/portal development. Helm deployments set `required`. |
| `APP_STUDIO_REST_ONLY` | Legacy local-development compatibility flag. Used only when `APP_STUDIO_CONTROLLER_MODE` is unset; `true` selects `rest-only`. |
| `APP_STUDIO_MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` | Comma-separated `key-id:base64-aes-key` entries for message content and metadata encryption at rest |
| `APP_STUDIO_MESSAGE_RETENTION` | Retention window (`time.ParseDuration`, e.g. `720h`) |
| `APP_STUDIO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Filesystem root for App Studio project workspaces and local file tools |
| `APP_STUDIO_ASSISTANT_MAX_ITERATIONS` | Per-run model-call ceiling. Default `200`. Exhaustion fails the run with `iteration_limited`. Only an explicit `0` or `unlimited` removes the ceiling, and the provider logs that it is running unbounded; never do this for untrusted tenants. |
| `APP_STUDIO_ASSISTANT_ROLLOUT_BUDGET_TOKENS` | Per-run weighted-token budget (sampled tokens at weight 1, non-cached prompt tokens at 0.25). Default `2000000`. Reminders survive compaction within the run; a new run in the same conversation starts from zero. Exhaustion produces `failed` with `budget_limited` / `session_budget_exceeded`. Only an explicit `0` or `unlimited` disables it (logged). |
| `APP_STUDIO_ORG_MONTHLY_USD_CAP` | Per-organization monthly model spend cap in USD (decimals allowed). Default `100`. Every model call is priced from the provider's reported token usage with a built-in per-model list-price table (unknown models are charged a frontier-tier rate), accumulated in the store per organization and UTC calendar month, and checked before each model call across all projects, runs, and replicas. When reached, the run fails with `budget_limited` / `org_spend_cap_exceeded`, the user-facing error names the cap, and a `spend_cap_reached` run event is recorded. Only an explicit `0` or `unlimited` disables the cap (logged). |
| `APP_STUDIO_ASSISTANT_MODEL_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Active model context window used for token-pressure compaction (default `128000` when provider model metadata is unavailable). |
| `APP_STUDIO_MCP_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | `true` → skip TLS verify on MCP calls (dev) |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` | `true` → skip TLS verification only for preview readiness probes (local dev with a self-signed Gateway) |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BRIDGE_ENABLED` | Enables the signed DOM annotation bridge for supported development previews; set `false` for a deployment-wide kill switch. |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BRIDGE_SIGNING_KEY` | PEM-encoded P-256 private key used to sign short-lived ES256 iframe capabilities |
| `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_BRIDGE_SIGNING_KEY_ID` | Stable key ID matching the public JWK independently deployed to the preview bridge |

## Health and readiness

`GET /healthz` is process liveness and never follows readiness: the API
server, the assistant supervisor and the replica-affinity forwarder keep
serving whatever the controllers are doing.

`GET /readyz` is `provider-sdk/vwhealth`: it reports whether this process can
reach the `ai.railgrid.ai` APIExport virtual workspace, and — while this
replica holds the `app-studio-controllers` Lease — whether the multicluster
provider is actually watching tenant workspaces. A replica that is not leading
has nothing attached and is ready on the probe alone, so a standby cannot wedge
a rollout. A pod in `required` mode that resolved no provider kubeconfig stays
unready, because there is nothing to probe with. The heartbeat is gated on the
same answer: the hub records any received beat as liveness, so the provider
goes quiet and lets the TTL mark it stale rather than staying green over
controllers that are not running.

The controllers themselves run under `provider-sdk/leaderelection`, rebuilt per
term, so scaling the deployment past one replica keeps every Project, Session
and Studio single-writer. See
[`docs/app-studio-replica-awareness.md`](../../docs/app-studio-replica-awareness.md)
for what is still project-affine.

## Local message history

`make run-provider-app-studio` starts/reuses a local Postgres container by
default and passes `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` to the provider:

```sh
make app-studio-db-up
make run-provider-app-studio
```

Preview browser access drives the workspace's shared headless browser — the
Infrastructure provider's Playwright MCP `browser` template, provisioned once
per workspace by the Studio reconciler — over the Infrastructure data plane.
There is no App Studio browser worker to run. When the shared Browser is Ready,
App Studio discovers the upstream MCP catalog, filters it through an explicit
allowlist, and exposes the approved native `browser_*` tools and their input
schemas directly to the model. Arbitrary-code tools such as
`browser_evaluate`/`browser_run_code` and the old aggregate inspection or
interaction wrappers are not model-facing capabilities.

The shared browser uses MCP initialize/initialized, a persistent GET event
stream, POST tool calls, and DELETE session close. App Studio owns the session
owner tuple, preview-origin and private-preview handoff checks, the
source-synchronization fence, and post-call snapshot/tab safety. Native tool
receipts are the browser evidence; a lost mutating call is returned as unknown
and is never replayed, while a safe read can be reconstructed once only when no
interaction is pending.

The database container is named `railgrid-app-studio-postgres`, listens on
`127.0.0.1:55432`, and stores data under `.kcp/app-studio-postgres/`. Both
Tiltfiles expose it as the `app-studio-db` resource, so hard-refreshing the UI
or rebuilding the provider no longer drops prior conversation history.

Both Tilt stacks also expose an `app-studio-preview-bridge-key` resource.
It atomically generates and reuses a P-256 key under
`.kcp/app-studio-preview-bridge/`. The App Studio process receives the private
key and derived key ID; Infrastructure receives only the matching public JWKS
and propagates it into development-preview init containers. The directory is
gitignored and uses mode `0700`; the private key uses mode `0600`. Delete that
directory only when intentionally rotating the local key, then restart the
App Studio and Infrastructure Tilt resources so both sides receive the new
pair. Local Make/Tilt targets intentionally ignore one-sided signing-key or
JWKS environment overrides; use the Helm values or launch the binaries directly
when testing a custom key pair.

To use your own database, set `APP_STUDIO_DATABASE_URL` in the environment or in
`providers/app-studio/.env` (copy from `.env.example`). To intentionally use the
old throwaway behavior, set `APP_STUDIO_IN_MEMORY_MESSAGE_STORE=true`.

Action-enabled development sandboxes also require `RAILGRID_ACTIONS_EXTERNAL_URL` in
that environment file (or the launcher environment). `make run-provider-app-studio`
forwards the explicitly configured value; it does not substitute the provider's
internal `RAILGRID_HUB_URL`, `localhost`, or an insecure HTTP URL. The origin must be
reachable from the sandbox pod and trusted by its system CA; configure deployment
CA material separately when a private certificate authority is used. Set
`RAILGRID_ACTIONS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` (or the direct `RAILGRID_ACTIONS_CA_BUNDLE` value) for
that case. The bundle is copied into a public ConfigMap-backed development
mount and added to Go/Node trust roots; an unset bundle leaves the image's
system trust unchanged. Helm deployments can use
`hub.actionsCABundleConfigMap` to mount the same public PEM file into App
Studio.

## Resilient assistant conversations

Once a Project and its first user message exist, App Studio owns assistant work
on the provider lifecycle rather than on an HTTP request. Its public contract is
Thread → Turn → Item: clients create or select an assistant thread, `POST
.../assistant/threads/{thread}/turns`, materialize the transcript with `GET
.../threads/{thread}/items`, and follow typed events from `GET
.../threads/{thread}/events`. Event sequence numbers and `Last-Event-ID` make
reconnection incremental. Closing an SSE connection only removes that
subscriber; it never cancels the Eino worker. The former `/messages`, latest-run,
resume, stop, and snapshot-stream routes are no longer public.

A turn's `status` describes the run, not its steps: a turn whose tool steps
failed still ends `completed`. To read the step outcome without scanning every
`item.completed` event, use the failure summary that the turn object carries in
the `turn.completed`, `turn.failed`, and `turn.interrupted` payloads (at
`.payload.turn`) and in `GET .../threads/{thread}/turns/{turn}`:
`failedItems` counts the turn's `dynamicToolCall`/`modelInput` items that ended
`failed`, `recoveredItems` counts failed file updates that a linked
`recoveryOf` retry then repaired (they are not counted as failed),
`rejectedItems` counts steps that did not run because their approval was
denied (their items read `failed`, but they are not counted as failed), and
`failures` lists up to five failed items as `{itemID, title, category,
message, referenceID}` taken from each item's diagnostic. All four are omitted
when zero. The summary is derived from the turn's durable items, so the turn
detail route also reports it for turns that completed before it existed.

A message submitted while the current run is working is durable steering for
that same run, not a replacement run. The request names the expected run and is
accepted only for the actor who started it. The supervisor persists an
idempotent receipt, the user item, a new assistant segment, and the advanced run
revision before Eino can observe the input. Eino drains steering between model
calls; input that races with a final response is carried into the new segment.
Admission and the terminal boundary share one lock, so late input is either
queued or rejected for the next run, never acknowledged and lost. The active
collaboration mode remains sticky.

New assistant runs use one sticky collaboration mode: `Default`, `Plan`, or
`Review`. `Plan` is read-only. `Review` is an explicitly started, independently
durable read-only turn over the `current_workspace` target; clients start one
with `POST .../assistant/threads/{thread}/reviews` and may provide bounded review
instructions. It reports evidence-backed findings and is never an automatic
completion gate. `Default` follows the user's request directly and exposes the
current evidence tools plus these source-mutation tools: `create_file`,
`replace_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_file`, and `move_file`. `read_file` returns
bounded structured data; only a complete read carries the opaque `version`
needed for a mutation, while partial reads are inspection-only. `create_file`
is always create-only: it never replaces an existing file and has no
phase-dependent or initial-build variant. `replace_file` atomically replaces a
whole file and requires the exact `expectedVersion` from a complete same-turn
read. `edit_file` performs exact `oldString`/`newString` replacement (with an
explicit `replaceAll` option) and, like `delete_file` and `move_file`, requires
that complete same-turn read plus its `expectedVersion`; move destinations must
be unused. Paths are normalized and authorized by the server, and stale,
ambiguous, partial, or otherwise invalid mutations fail without changing the
file. There is no patch grammar and no backwards-compatibility alias. Mutation
failures use bounded structured typed metadata (code, operation, path, and
guidance); an optional server-issued `recoveryOf` only correlates a retry in
the activity feed, is presentation-only, and never grants authority or
substitutes for a fresh read. Retrying and recovered feed entries retain the
durable evidence of the original failure. The semantic action router, WorkItem
promotion flow, phase-driven inner loop, and model-facing workspace hydration
tool have been removed. The portal's explicit **Implement plan** action starts
a fresh Default turn rather than silently changing the mode of a running turn.

The Thread/Turn/Item cutover intentionally starts with no canonical threads.
Pre-cutover assistant history is not projected into the new public transcript.
Legacy run/message rows remain an internal Eino persistence bridge during the
cutover and are not exposed to clients.

Every model response batch is admitted before dispatch. Tool-call IDs are
deterministic, malformed calls and conflicting IDs fail closed, and the model's
call order and cardinality are preserved. Eino retains native concurrent
execution and ordered rejoin, while a run-scoped reader/writer gate permits
only explicitly parallel-safe reads to overlap; effects, unknown tools, and
MCP tools are exclusive. An append-only
`AssistantRunEvent` ledger records each admitted call and exact model-visible
result together with its typed semantic disposition. Model-call audit entries
also bind the visible tool contracts to a stable schema digest. The ledger
provides idempotency within the active run and between concurrent workers; it
is not a provider-restart continuation mechanism.

Transient setup failures and incomplete model streams retry from the current
accepted turn history. Partial responses are discarded before tools can be
dispatched or prose published. The configured retry count is bounded at the
execution boundary with a hard maximum of 100, independently of HTTP settings
validation; exhaustion returns the original classified stream failure.

The encrypted, append-only thread event stream records user and assistant items,
tool calls, plans, steering, approval/input requests, and lifecycle transitions.
Thread and turn rows are materialized projections; a turn's terminal projection
and terminal event commit atomically. New turns reconstruct model context from
the latest persisted compaction plus subsequent conversation evidence instead
of dropping tool results. Reasoning and secrets are not stored there.

Source mutations produce bounded server-generated diffs and structured
operation/path metadata for the audit and action projections. The repository
commit bridge carries the complete atomic upsert/delete bundle to provider-code.
If a mutation fails after an I/O failure, the actual remaining paths are
reported as a partial failure and retained in the durable dirty-path set; stale
reads for those paths are invalidated before another mutation. Dirty paths are
workspace information, not a hidden verification or commit obligation.
Repository commits use the complete server-owned durable dirty bundle,
including paths from earlier turns; the model supplies commit prose rather
than authoritative file scope. Approval is bound to the bundle's current path
membership and content digest, and only successfully committed paths are
removed from the dirty set. The model is
instructed never to commit unless the user explicitly requests repository
persistence.

After a source mutation, runtime verification requires positive completion of
workspace synchronization for that exact mutation revision before it can report
`ready`. Operational readiness covers synchronization, process/log health, and
preview reachability only. It never proves rendered content, interactions, data
flow, application behavior, or acceptance criteria. Verification remains an
optional model-selected tool; middleware does not force it or rewrite the final
assistant response.

Mutation syncs are serialized in submission order per Project UID, and their
revision, status, failure, and one bounded retry are checkpointed across
permission or follow-up interrupts. Runtime verification and commit both hash
the complete dirty bundle. Verification remains optional, but when a run
claims both verified and committed state they must refer to the same digest;
membership or content changes invalidate approval and any stale verification
binding. While a run
owns the project, server-side reservations reject external workspace hydration,
template switching, manual sync, and deletion; matching disabled portal controls
are only the UX layer over that server boundary.

This remains a single-replica execution design: work cannot continue across a
provider restart. Recovery marks an orphaned active turn `interrupted`, while
durable permission and input checkpoints remain resumable. Interrupt first
persists the internal stopping transition, then asks Eino to cancel gracefully.
Clients recover from the canonical item projection and resume the typed event
stream after their last sequence; they do not depend on token replay.

Every effect is re-admitted at the Stop-serialized supervisor boundary against
the run's durable actor digest. The model-visible project/repository snapshot
and executable tool adapters share one per-sample request snapshot, so a tool
cannot execute against an older request view than the one shown to the model.

The public turn lifecycle is `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, and
`interrupted`. Approval and structured-input waits are typed items/events within
an in-progress turn, not extra public lifecycle states. Model, provider, and
budget failures are `failed` with structured error data; explicit interruption
and provider process loss are `interrupted`. The portal renders terminal errors
separately from real assistant prose and re-enables input for every terminal
state.

Approval defaults to `on_request`: routine workspace work proceeds, while
consequential external effects and repository commits ask. `always_ask` asks
before every state-changing/external action, and `never` denies actions that
need authority. Bounded compiler, test, and lint commands run automatically in
the synchronized development runtime under `on_request`; they never write back
to App Studio source. A plan communicates intended work and progress; it never
grants permission. Default collaboration mode has no structured follow-up tool, while
Plan mode may request structured input and remains read-only.

Lifecycle logs contain only organization, workspace, project, run, revision,
and status fields. They intentionally omit prompt text, assistant content,
tool arguments, and credentials.

```

## Local project files

App Studio keeps project files in its own workspace root so the assistant can
list, read, search, and safely mutate text files before asking provider-code to
commit selected changed files to git. Set `APP_STUDIO_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to choose
the directory; the binary defaults to a temp directory, while the Helm chart
mounts a persistent volume at `/var/lib/railgrid-app-studio/workspaces`.

The assistant-facing workspace tools are App Studio local tools. Provider-code
remains the git-source boundary: `commit_project_files` reads changed workspace
files, represents missing dirty paths as deletions, and delegates the atomic
upsert/delete commit to the Code provider's `code__commit_files` tool. A
workspace move is persisted as an upsert of the destination and deletion of the
source in the same repository commit.

The background convergence loop takes a different route to the same place: the
Project reconciler (`controller/project/commit.go`) invokes the Code provider's
`repositories/commit/v1` **action** as the project identity, staging oversized
payloads through `repositories/stage-commit-bundle`, and follows the
`RepositoryCommit` the action names over the watch it already runs. The two
surfaces share the workspace settlement ledger, so neither double-commits what
the other settled; moving the assistant's tool onto the same action is open
work.

The reverse direction is `hydrate_workspace`: it reads the repository tree
through the Code provider's `code__checkout_repository` tool and writes it into
the workspace (tracked files are overwritten, workspace-only files stay), then
schedules a development sync. Because it discards uncommitted edits to tracked
files, the tool always pauses for the user's approval, in every approval mode
except Never, and is offered only in Default mode on implementation turns. The
same operation is reachable without the assistant through
`POST /api/projects/{project}/hydrate-workspace` and `railgrid app sync`.

## Development runtime

App Studio owns the project-facing development API and workspace. A project
selects an infrastructure `Template`; its development contract declares the
component workspace paths and the instance resource to provision. App Studio
creates or deletes that tenant-scoped instance, then routes file sync and
runtime operations through the infrastructure provider's published data-plane
subresources as the requesting user. App Studio never holds a credential for
the infrastructure provider's runtime cluster. See
[`docs/app-studio-sandbox-runtime.md`](../../docs/app-studio-sandbox-runtime.md)
for the current boundary and
[`docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md`](../../docs/app-studio-runtime-decoupling.md)
for the retained design proposal.

`POST .../authorize-development-preview` reads the selected instance's
`status.url` and probes the public edge. It returns `ready: true` and the URL
only after DNS/TLS/routing is serving; the portal retries readiness while the
edge is provisioning. The preview URL is the Template's normal public route,
not an App Studio-signed preview token, and browser traffic goes directly to
that route. `APP_STUDIO_PREVIEW_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` is only a local-dev
override for the readiness probe.

App Studio only GETs the referenced object while reconciling and never creates,
updates, owns, or deletes it. Integrations are managed through
`/api/projects/{project}/integrations` (GET/POST), removed with DELETE on the
alias, and invoked with POST on `{alias}/invoke`. On create or reactivation,
App Studio resolves the hub's `/api/providers` catalog (as the provider) and records a
server-owned `schemaDigest`, `grantedBy`, and `grantedAt` for every exact
action/resource grant. Revocation preserves that grant audit and records
`revokedBy`/`revokedAt`; reactivation requires fresh catalog verification and
consent when declared.

Invocation re-verifies the persisted grant digest against the live catalog
(`409` on drift), then forwards `{"input": ...}` to the bound provider's action
as **App Studio**, through App Studio's own APIExport virtual workspace, at the
kube path of the custom subresource
`/clusters/{cluster}/apis/{group}/{version}/{resource}/{name}/{action}` (the
contract version is the serving provider's declaration, not a path segment).
kcp authorizes the call against the claim App Studio's export carries on that
coordinate, so an integration's action must be one App Studio has claimed
(`manifest.yaml` `spec.requires[].resources[]`); the caller's identity
travels as a label only. The route is composed from the coordinate the catalog
publishes the action on — its parent `spec.export.resources[]` entry's
`apiVersion`, `kind` and plural name;
App Studio never learns a provider URL or embeds provider transport logic.
Caller credentials, provider backend URLs, resource overrides, and raw SQL
are rejected.

Generated server applications install the public
`@crwilhit/railgrid-actions-node@0.1.0` artifact under the stable consumer name
with this exact dependency alias in the server component's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@railgrid/actions-node": "npm:@crwilhit/railgrid-actions-node@0.1.0"
  }
}
```

Application code keeps the canonical import
`import { createActionsClient } from '@railgrid/actions-node';` and can call
`client.integration(alias).invoke(...)` or `invokeEnvelope(...)`. The SDK is
server-only, requires an absolute HTTPS base URL (except an explicit loopback
test override), reads the short-lived workload token from
`RAILGRID_ACTIONS_TOKEN_FILE` on every request or from a refreshable credential
provider, and retries once with `forceRefresh` after a `401`. The bootstrap
token used by the workload exchange is never the app token; no development
token fallback exists. Development sandboxes install this declared dependency
through the component toolchain; `railgrid-dev-agent` does not project an SDK or
mount `/node_modules`.

## Running it yourself

This provider can run in your own cluster instead of on the platform. railgrid
creates a workspace for it in your organization, mints a credential scoped to
that workspace alone, and generates the exact `helm` commands — under
**Providers → Self-Hosting** in the portal.

Nothing to fill in: the infrastructure and code identity hashes it needs are
resolved for you. It does expect the `infrastructure` and `code` providers to be
available — self-host those too if you want the whole chain in your cluster.

Once installed, the provider registers itself and your workspaces enable it
exactly like the platform copy. See
[docs/byo-providers.md](../../docs/byo-providers.md) for how the flow works, and
[deploy/chart/README.md](deploy/chart/README.md) for every chart value.
