// Rendering self-hosting install instructions.
//
// A provider declares how it is deployed once, in CatalogEntry.spec.selfHosting,
// and the hub turns that into the exact commands one organization needs to run
// its own copy against the workspace the hub just created for it. The provider
// is the only party that knows its chart; the hub is the only party that knows
// the org's workspace, credential, and hub URL. Neither could produce these
// instructions alone, which is why this lives here rather than in a doc.
//
// Everything rendered is deployment metadata. Nothing here grants privilege:
// the credential the instructions reference is minted separately and is
// workspace-scoped, and a provider cannot influence what it can reach by
// changing anything in this file's inputs.
