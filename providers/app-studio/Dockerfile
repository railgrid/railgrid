# Built in the standalone railgrid/provider-app-studio mirror (synced from the
# railgrid monorepo at providers/app-studio/ — see README). The build context is
# the mirror root, i.e. the contents of providers/app-studio/, so all paths
# below are relative to this module's root.

# 1. Build the App Studio portal micro-frontend (Vite + Vue → portal/dist).
#    portal/ is a self-contained npm project, so only its lockfile + source
#    are needed.
FROM node:22-alpine AS portal
WORKDIR /portal
COPY providers/app-studio/portal/package.json providers/app-studio/portal/package-lock.json* ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
COPY providers/app-studio/portal/ ./
RUN npm run build

# 2. Build the Go binary. assets.go //go:embeds portal/dist, overlaid from the
#    node stage so the bundle is fresh. The module depends on the published
#    github.com/railgrid/provider-sdk (no local replace), so it resolves from the
#    proxy in a standalone build context.
FROM golang:1.26-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY providers/app-studio/go.mod providers/app-studio/go.sum ./
# In-tree provider-sdk (go.mod replace => ../../provider-sdk; from
# WORKDIR /src that resolves to /provider-sdk). Build context is the
# REPO ROOT: docker build -f providers/app-studio/Dockerfile .
COPY provider-sdk/ /provider-sdk/
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod go mod download
COPY providers/app-studio/ ./
COPY --from=portal /portal/dist ./portal/dist
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/go-build CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o /out/app-studio-provider .

# 3. Minimal runtime image. The portal bundle is baked into the binary; the
#    The two declarative objects `init` applies — the generated
#    APIExport and its APIResourceSchemas — are baked at /etc/railgrid/kcp (RAILGRID_KCP_DIR).
