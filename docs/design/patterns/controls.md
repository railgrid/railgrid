# Control selection and input patterns

The Vue and framework-neutral implementations in the
[FormSelect component](../components/form-select.md) own the product-consistent
single-select popup. Native select popups remain sanctioned. Native checkboxes
and radios are the baseline; custom styling is reserved for dense composite
rows and shared toggle recipes.

The shared `.k-input` recipe uses `box-sizing: border-box` and full available
width, keeping borders and padding inside the declared width. On coarse-pointer
input it supplies a minimum 44×44px target. A native checkbox keeps its
14×14px glyph through `.k-checkbox`; when a larger touch target is needed,
apply `.k-checkbox-hit` to the associated checkbox or radio label so the label
supplies the minimum 44×44px hit area while the native glyph remains compact.

Fields use a consistent reading order: label, control, then help or validation.
Keep a short required or optional marker with the label; put explanatory copy
below the control and connect it with `aria-describedby`. Use a short label as
the accessible name so a screen reader does not read the explanation twice.
An error may replace the hint or precede it, but both stay below the control.
Adjacent fields align at the top; a longer hint must not move a neighboring
control down. Form-wide instructions can precede a group of fields.

Use a native `fieldset` and `legend` for related radio or checkbox choices.
The legend is a field label: match the size, weight, color, and sentence case
of neighboring labels, rather than the uppercase treatment of a section
heading. Put group help after the choices and associate it with the fieldset.
An individual choice can carry a description beneath its title within the
clickable label. Keep the native control aligned with that title.

For a range input, no implementation is currently shipped. When needed, use a
native `<input type="range">` with `accent-color` first. A custom variant is a
2px `surface-overlay` track (`rounded-xs`), accent filled portion, and a
12×12px square 2px-radius `text-primary` thumb matching the toggle knob; focus
uses the standard ring and readouts use mono `tabular-nums`.

For date/time input, no custom picker is shipped. Dates are read-only mono
output via `portal/src/utils/time.ts` (relative plus title absolute). If input
is needed, use native `date`/`datetime-local` styled as `.k-input`. A range is
two inputs joined by an en dash, not a popover calendar.

For the command palette, no implementation is shipped. The planned contract is
a centered 560px, 6px `surface-raised` panel with hairline, heavy elevation,
and `surface/60` scrim. Its borderless 14px `.k-input` variant carries a mono
`⌘K` keycap; results use dropdown-menu items with a 10px mono uppercase group
eyebrow. This is the one larger-feeling chrome surface, but it still has no
gradients and one accent.
